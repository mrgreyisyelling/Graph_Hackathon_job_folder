# GRC-20 Data Publishing: Deployment Considerations

## Current Implementation Status
This project provides a framework for transforming Pinellas County permit and deed transfer data into a format compatible with GRC-20 publishing. However, the current implementation is a simulation and requires additional configuration.

## Prerequisites
1. GRC-20 Wallet
   - Obtain a wallet with sufficient credentials
   - Ensure wallet has permissions to publish to the intended space

2. Space Configuration
   - Obtain a valid Space ID from the GRC-20 network
   - Configure the Space ID in the `.env` file

## Limitations of Current Implementation
- Simulated hash generation
- No actual blockchain/IPFS publishing
- Placeholder publishing logic

## Next Steps
1. Obtain GRC-20 Network Credentials
2. Configure Actual Publishing Mechanism
3. Implement Proper Error Handling
4. Add Comprehensive Logging
5. Implement Retry Mechanisms

## Recommended Workflow
1. Validate CSV Data
2. Transform Data to Triples
3. Authenticate with GRC-20 Network
4. Publish Transformed Data
5. Verify Publication Status

## Security Considerations
- Never commit `.env` file with actual credentials
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper access controls

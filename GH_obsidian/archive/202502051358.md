Hello-

We are mapping the meaning space of the crypto community. This will serve as the first version of the underlying information network that that will describe all of web3. 

The graph is developing the standard  to define the relationship between the entities of this system. 

It will allow for a greater freedom and precision when searching for information.

As you can see - we are populating it initially with the information surrounding the central groups - specifically looking at skills, jobs, and education in different areas.

After this is completed though, it will be necessary to develop a way to continue develop 'schemas', new entities, and new relationships to fully describe the world, efficiently.

## **5. ETHDenver & Hackathon Strategy**

To **test and validate this idea**, your hackathon project could be:

1. **A Prototype Graph Explorer**
    
    - **Ingest Web3 content dynamically** (Twitter, Mirror.xyz, DAO forums).
    - **Cluster similar concepts** using AI-assisted embeddings.
    - **Visualize how meaning flows & shifts over time**.
2. **AI-Assisted Knowledge Graph Maintenance**
    
    - Build a tool that **suggests structure** for raw knowledge.
    - **Identify conflicts** between different definitions of Web3 concepts.
3. **A Browser for Web3 Meaning**
    
    - Show **how different DAOs/projects talk about similar topics**.
    - Allow **dynamic exploration & refinement**.

@yanivgraph this might seem off topic, but have you read 'Tigana' (recently)? I ran into it again yesterday - the main theme is this idea of creating a culture that exists longer then a person, and how that memory of this culture is what joins people together. Story is about how this was magically wiped from memory.

Anyway - DKG has a way of doing that, for a community. The memory of the community is a memory of how things played out. What is connected to what - etc. 

The system we are creating here is much more macro

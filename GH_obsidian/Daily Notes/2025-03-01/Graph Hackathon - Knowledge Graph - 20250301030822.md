I am falling behind in many tasks.

I got caught up in working out the whole problem into my mind.

I have a load time and sometimes it takes forever.

I am at the point, I know what I need to do, and I just need to do it.

But - I have been working everywhere else, and I need to put it down here, so we can break it down into chunks, and do it.

# Pre- Introduction

First before I go further - this is a cry for help. 

I am doing this in a vacuum because I am going it alone. But I want to work with other people, I just don't want to compromise what I am doing. I invite any interest or creative thinking. I am done working alone, in the dark. I am changing this. #dinokill 

# Introduction

My name is Michael Penta. I am a loser. You will not find me up on the couches with kings. 

I am interested in only one thing, and that is the creation of a system of relation that is stable, long term, and  approximately 150 persons in size. 

My goal is that this system is agnostic. Meaning, its definition, if not its execution, is 'pure math' (whatever the fuck that means). My goal, before all else - is the production of knowledge to solve basic human-scale problems. This means clean, public, systems. Something that is EASILY reproduced, globally, under a variety of conditions. And capable of providing us the informations we need to come up with the solutions we want.  I am hopefully. I am Buckminster fuller level of hopeful for man kind. 

But I am and have been taken for a fool many times - so I will temper that hope with an understanding of how much work I have in front of me. That is why I invite assistance, but I understand that people, better than me, less egotistical than me are probably capable of doing much more faster - if I just give them the plans.

I have so many reasons to pursue this - it is a waste of time to lecture on it. I have made many errors prior to this point and they are not well documented. That was a mistake brought on by shame and insecurity. This is an attempt at something else. 

# Structure of the project and break down of goals

Ok - to fully communicate what I am doing here - you need to develop a concept of community that is much more specific then you are used to, so we can write it down, but still as wishy-washy as you are used to. 

We are developing a cluster of people -150 - and attempting to increase the density of relation among them. In the abstract, perhaps this sounds simple, but its not. In real life, its nearly impossible, outside of direct work conditions. 

Vague, weak associations are far more normal as the density of the population increases.

Intentionally joining a cluster of individuals to begin thinking cohesively as a group, is complex, if you are not able to control and standardize many things about their life and lifestyle. 

What I am suggesting here is a system that is able to do that 'naturally' - naturally meaning: no direct coercion. Effective use of incentives. So the system I am designing is essentially an economic system, but our interest is in the measurement of the social system beneath it.

1. The unit we are interested in is 150, but - to generate those conditions, I believe it requires a population much larger to 'quickly' catalyze the process. I am using 5000 as my 'population' number. My goal, at this point, is a 150 person, self selected, economic union. So of this 5000 person 'general population' who may or may not have any 'direct connection' to the system that we are creating - 150 people will choose to become members of this union. This will be demonstrated by their willingness to deposit some amount for the membership.
2. Within this larger social structure - we want to develop the practice of organizing and sharing information in this fashion. Why.
	1. Its emphesizes local connections. There _is_ signifigant value to acquiring and developing non-local relationships, there is life long value - it does not out weigh the effect that direct interaction has on social outcomes. The denser and more 'liberal'(ie diverse) this centralized system of relation is, the higher the value of the system. You want the social network of a community to encourage open, safe, mutually respectful exchange. The way this occurs - is by the community creating relationships amongst themselves, and organizing themselves into local groups capable of representing one another fairly. 
	2. By placing information into this system, it allows the population with access to this information the ability to more easily match needs to available information, resources, or labor 
		1. job availability with skill availability - in both the gig sense and the contract employment sense of the word. By filtering this information into a readily accessible system, it becomes more possible to create direct connections based on 'mutually beneficial outcomes' = ie fair economic exchange. A tremendous amount of 'back information' and 'trust/verifcation' issues exist. 
		2. it can basically eliminate the costs associated with local advertising, and support dense exchange systems, with high trust capabilities. When you focus the local population into the role of monitor of economic exchange, you have different outcomes and more formal/structured outcomes. This is good for business among diverse networks. 
		3. provides high control to the network about what information is allowed in and what information is drawn out, and by who.

4. By clustering the information locally, and in a structured manner, it creates conditions that allows these individual clusterings to be organized as a group. Standardizing the system of knowledge created from this space.
5. Systems of knowledge are important to the health of a local economic system, because it is costly and complicated to guarantee exchange. The cheapest way is through the socialization of these exchanges, tieing the indivdual's role in the larger community, to their ability to respect the 'rules of exchange'.
6. Therefore - generating a meaningful system of knowledge that allows the community to understand and deal with itself is important.
7. The challenge of these system in general public life is that they are often ambiguous. A person's known position and 'state' in the network is not 'telegraphed', so instead a mixture of sociability and noisiness helps the community resolve these systems. This works to a certain scale, but beyond that you begin to have break down in systems.
8. The solutions developed have worked, but in the last 20-40 years there has been a significant change in the nature of work and therefore the nature of socialblty.
9. What has 'failed' to fill the gap is a new social system capable of bridging this infromation gap between what has become a local and non-local divide. Because these new systems of communication where base primarially on systems of capital, the distribution of the benefits and use of these systems has been uneven in their outcomes and timelines. 
10. New distributed system suggest that they are able to do this, easily, and this provides a unique opportunity to establish systems that are far less resource hungry and capable of providing meaningful connection between internal elements. The goal - is to stabilize the local knowledge graph and make the cost of accessing basically zero. This will ensure that all local resources and needs will be available within the system.
11. In the system that I am designing, the goal is to enable a system where the 'collection' of information and the distribution of that information are two indistinct steps. This allows control and packaging of the infromation to happen immedaitely in the process. This allows individuals to have direct visibility of what infroamtion they are sharing and with who. This also directly ties an area or a person to a piece of information. 
12. Distribution of information involves basically 'emailing' the submissions to other systems. This method allows two types of control:
	1. people can subscribe to an information point
	2. that inforamtion point can control who is sent the informaion in the first step.

13. I believe there will be many types of 'points' and that some will be public and others will be private. The relationship these points have with the surrounding system will depend on the degree they communicate with the larger system what they do.
14. The local 'union' is elective at some point - there can be multiple unions, the point is the relationship between the node and the union is direct and therefore the relatiosnhips between the union and the member of that node's community.
15. The idea is that the union is processing this information with the purpose of providing control to the community about how it is used.

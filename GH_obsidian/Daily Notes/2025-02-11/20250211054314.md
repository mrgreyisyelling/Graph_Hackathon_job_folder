To **change the password** of your Neo4j server on your computer, follow these steps:

---

## **Method 1: Change Password from Neo4j Browser**

1. Open **Neo4j Desktop**.
2. Click on your **database instance** and make sure it is **running**.
3. Open the **Neo4j Browser** (click ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù).
4. Run this command to change the password:
    
    ```cypher
    ALTER CURRENT USER SET PASSWORD FROM 'old-password' TO 'new-password';
    ```
    
    **Replace** `'old-password'` and `'new-password'` with your actual values.

## **Method 2: Reset Password via Command Line**

If you **forgot the password**, you can reset it manually.

### **Step 1: Stop Neo4j**

Run the following command (depending on your system):

**On Linux/macOS:**

```bash
neo4j stop
```

**On Windows (PowerShell as Admin):**

```powershell
net stop neo4j
```

---

### **Step 2: Reset Password**

1. Open the Neo4j **configuration file**:
    
    ```bash
    nano /var/lib/neo4j/data/dbms/auth
    ```
    
2. Delete the `auth` file completely:
    
    ```bash
    rm /var/lib/neo4j/data/dbms/auth
    ```
    

---

### **Step 3: Restart Neo4j and Set New Password**

1. Start Neo4j again:
    
    ```bash
    neo4j start
    ```
    
2. Open Neo4j Browser and **log in with**:
    
    ```
    Username: neo4j
    Password: neo4j
    ```
    
3. Neo4j will **prompt you to set a new password**.

## **Method 3: Manually Update Password in Config File**

If the above steps don‚Äôt work, manually update the password in `neo4j.conf`:

4. Open the config file:
    
    ```bash
    nano /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
    ```
    
5. Look for:
    
    ```
    dbms.security.auth_enabled=true
    ```
    
    If needed, **disable authentication temporarily** by changing it to:
    
    ```
    dbms.security.auth_enabled=false
    ```
    
6. Restart Neo4j:
    
    ```bash
    neo4j restart
    ```
    
7. Login **without a password**, then enable authentication again:
    
    ```cypher
    ALTER CURRENT USER SET PASSWORD TO 'new-password';
    ```
    
8. Re-enable authentication in `neo4j.conf`:
    
    ```
    dbms.security.auth_enabled=true
    ```
    
9. Restart Neo4j again:
    
    ```bash
    neo4j restart
    ```

```
Username: neo4j
Password: your-new-password
```

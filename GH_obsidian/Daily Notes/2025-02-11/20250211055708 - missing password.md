To **change the password** of your Neo4j server on your computer, follow these steps:

---

## **Method 1: Change Password from Neo4j Browser**

## **Method 3: Manually Update Password in Config File**

If the above steps donâ€™t work, manually update the password in `neo4j.conf`:

2. Open the config file:
    
    ```bash
    nano /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
    ```
    
3. Look for:
    
    ```
    dbms.security.auth_enabled=true
    ```
    
    If needed, **disable authentication temporarily** by changing it to:
    
    ```
    dbms.security.auth_enabled=false
    ```
    
4. Restart Neo4j:
    
    ```bash
    neo4j restart
    ```
    
5. Login **without a password**, then enable authentication again:
    
    ```cypher
    ALTER CURRENT USER SET PASSWORD TO 'new-password';
    ```
    
6. Re-enable authentication in `neo4j.conf`:
    
    ```
    dbms.security.auth_enabled=true
    ```
    
7. Restart Neo4j again:
    
    ```bash
    neo4j restart
    ```

Try logging in with:

```
Username: neo4j
Password: your-new-password
```

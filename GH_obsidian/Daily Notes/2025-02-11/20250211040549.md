### **Dump and Reload the `Facility` Nodes in Neo4j**

If you need to **remove the existing `Facility` nodes** and **reload them with the missing `operational_schedule` field**, follow these steps:

---

## **1️⃣ Backup Existing Facilities (Optional)**

Before deleting anything, you can **export the existing facilities** just in case:

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility) 
RETURN f.facility_id, f.name, f.phone_number, f.type, f.operational_schedule, f.accepts_subsidies
LIMIT 10;
```

✅ **This lets you verify the missing field before deleting.**

---

## **2️⃣ Remove Existing Facility Nodes**

To **delete all `Facility` nodes and their relationships**, run:

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility) DETACH DELETE f;
```

✅ **This removes all facilities but keeps other entities intact.**

---

## **3️⃣ Ensure the Updated `facilities.csv` is Ready**

Re-export the `facilities.csv` file from SQLite to **include `operational_schedule`**:

```bash
sqlite3 childcare.db -header -csv "SELECT facility_id, facility_name, phone_number, facility_type, operational_schedule, accepts_subsidies FROM facilities;" > facilities.csv
```

✅ **Verify the CSV contains the missing field**:

```bash
cat facilities.csv | head -n 10
```

✅ **Move the CSV to Neo4j’s import folder**:

```bash
mv facilities.csv /var/lib/neo4j/import/
```

---

## **4️⃣ Reload Facility Data into Neo4j**

Now that `facilities.csv` is updated, re-import the `Facility` nodes:

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Facility {
    facility_id: row.facility_id, 
    name: row.facility_name, 
    phone_number: row.phone_number, 
    type: row.facility_type, 
    operational_schedule: row.operational_schedule, 
    accepts_subsidies: row.accepts_subsidies
});
```

✅ **This reloads facilities, including `operational_schedule`.**

## **5️⃣ Restore Facility Relationships**

Since we deleted all `Facility` nodes, we must **recreate relationships**:

### **🔗 Facility → Location**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_location_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (l:Location {location_id: row.location_id})
MERGE (f)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l);
```

### **🔗 Facility → Owner**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_owner_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (o:Owner {owner_id: row.owner_id})
MERGE (f)-[:OWNED_BY]->(o);
```

### **🔗 Facility → License**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_license_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (lic:License {license_id: row.license_id})
MERGE (f)-[:HAS_LICENSE]->(lic);
```

### **🔗 Facility → School District**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_school_district_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (sd:SchoolDistrict {district_id: row.district_id})
MERGE (f)-[:PART_OF_DISTRICT]->(sd);
```

---

## **6️⃣ Verify the Fix**

Once everything is reloaded, verify that the **`operational_schedule`** field is present:

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility) RETURN f.name, f.operational_schedule LIMIT 10;
```

✅ **If `operational_schedule` appears, the fix worked!** 🚀

---

### **🚀 Summary: How to Fix the Schema**

1️⃣ **Delete all existing `Facility` nodes** (`DETACH DELETE f`).  
2️⃣ **Re-export `facilities.csv` from SQLite** (include `operational_schedule`).  
3️⃣ **Move CSV to Neo4j import folder** (`mv facilities.csv /var/lib/neo4j/import/`).  
4️⃣ **Reload Facility nodes in Neo4j** (`LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM ...`).  
5️⃣ **Recreate relationships** (`MERGE (f)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l)`, etc.).  
6️⃣ **Verify `operational_schedule` is now included** (`MATCH (f:Facility) RETURN ...`).

🔥 **Now your Neo4j database is fixed and fully loaded!** 🚀 Let me know if you need any help!

You're right! Since **Zip Code is stored in the `Location` entity**, we need to **extract it from there** and create relationships properly. Here's the correct step-by-step process to structure the **Facility â†’ Location â†’ Zip Code â†’ City â†’ State** hierarchy.

---

## **1. Create Zip Code Nodes and Link Locations**

Since **Facilities are linked to `Location`**, we first need to **extract the Zip Code from `Location`** and create `ZipCode` nodes.

### **Cypher Query**

```cypher
MATCH (l:Location)
MERGE (z:ZipCode {code: l.zip_code})
MERGE (l)-[:HAS_ZIP]->(z);
```

âœ… This ensures that each **Location is linked to a Zip Code**.

### **Verify**

```cypher
MATCH (z:ZipCode)<-[:HAS_ZIP]-(l)
RETURN z.code, collect(l.facility_name) AS locations;
```

---

## **2. Link Facilities to Their Zip Code via Location**

Now, we connect `Facility` â†’ `ZipCode` **through `Location`**.

### **Cypher Query**

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l:Location)-[:HAS_ZIP]->(z:ZipCode)
MERGE (f)-[:IN_ZIP]->(z);
```

âœ… Now, each **Facility is linked to a Zip Code**.

### **Verify**

```cypher
MATCH (z:ZipCode)<-[:IN_ZIP]-(f)
RETURN z.code, collect(f.name) AS facilities;
```

---

## **3. Create City Nodes and Link to Locations**

Since `City` is also in `Location`, letâ€™s extract that.

### **Cypher Query**

```cypher
MATCH (l:Location)
MERGE (c:City {name: l.city})
MERGE (l)-[:IN_CITY]->(c);
```

âœ… Now, each **Location is linked to a City**.

### **Verify**

```cypher
MATCH (c:City)<-[:IN_CITY]-(l)

RETURN c.name, collect(l.city) AS locations;
```

---

## **4. Link Zip Codes to Cities**

Each **Zip Code belongs to a City**, so we create the relationship.

### **Cypher Query**

```cypher
MATCH (l:Location)-[:HAS_ZIP]->(z:ZipCode), (l)-[:IN_CITY]->(c:City)
MERGE (z)-[:PART_OF_CITY]->(c);
```

âœ… Now, **Zip Codes are connected to their Cities**.

### **Verify**

```cypher
MATCH (c:City)<-[:PART_OF_CITY]-(z)
RETURN c.name, collect(z.code) AS zip_codes;
```

---

## **5. Create State Nodes and Link to Cities**

Since **State is in `Location`**, extract and link it.

### **Cypher Query**

```cypher
MATCH (l:Location)
MERGE (s:State {name: l.state})
MERGE (l)-[:IN_STATE]->(s);
```

âœ… Now, **Locations are linked to States**.

### **Verify**

```cypher
MATCH (s:State)<-[:IN_STATE]-(l)
RETURN s.name, collect(l.facility_name) AS locations;
```

---

## **6. Link Cities to States**

Each **City belongs to a State**, so we establish that connection.

### **Cypher Query**

```cypher
MATCH (l:Location)-[:IN_CITY]->(c:City), (l)-[:IN_STATE]->(s:State)
MERGE (c)-[:IN_STATE]->(s);
```

âœ… Now, **Cities are linked to their States**.

### **Verify**

```cypher
MATCH (s:State)<-[:IN_STATE]-(c)
RETURN s.name, collect(c.name) AS cities;
```

---

## **7. Verify the Full Hierarchy**

Now, check if the **Facility â†’ Location â†’ Zip Code â†’ City â†’ State** hierarchy is correctly built.

### **Final Check**

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l:Location)-[:HAS_ZIP]->(z:ZipCode),
      (l)-[:IN_CITY]->(c:City),
      (l)-[:IN_STATE]->(s:State)
RETURN f.name, l.facility_name, z.code, c.name, s.name
LIMIT 10;
```

âœ… Expected output:

```
Facility      | Location      | ZipCode | City      | State
-------------------------------------------------------------
ABC Daycare  | Apollo Center | 12345   | Lansing   | Michigan
XYZ Preschool| Delton Comm.  | 67890   | Detroit   | Michigan
```

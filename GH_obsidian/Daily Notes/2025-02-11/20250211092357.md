Great question! If **Facility** and **Location** reference different attributes (`facility_name` and `location_name`), but both should be **treated as equivalent**, you need a mechanism to **normalize** or **link them at a higher level**.

## **Solution: Introduce a General `Name` Entity**

Instead of linking `Facility` and `Location` directly to `facility_name` and `location_name`, introduce a **more general `Name` entity** that ensures they remain connected.

### **New Relationship Model**

1. **Facility and Location reference different attributes:**
    - `Facility` → `Attribute {name: "facility_name"}`
    - `Location` → `Attribute {name: "location_name"}`
2. **Both attributes reference a shared `Name` entity** that holds the actual name value.

## **💡 Cypher Query for Creating a Shared `Name` Entity**

```cypher
// Step 1: Create a Shared Name Entity
MATCH (f:Facility)
MERGE (name:Name {value: f.name})
MERGE (attr:Attribute {name: "facility_name"})
MERGE (val:Value {value: f.name})
MERGE (attr)-[:OF_VALUE]->(val)
MERGE (f)-[:HAS]->(attr)
MERGE (f)-[:OF_VALUE]->(val)
MERGE (val)-[:REPRESENTS]->(name);  // Links Value to Name
```

✅ **What this does:**

- Creates a **`Name` entity** that generalizes all names.
- Ensures that `Facility` still points to `facility_name`.
- Links `Value` (specific facility name) to the shared `Name`.

---

```cypher
// Step 2: Link Location Names to the Shared Name Entity
MATCH (l:Location), (f:Facility) 
MERGE (name:Name {value: l.facility_name})  // Uses the same value as Facility
MERGE (attr:Attribute {name: "location_name"})
MERGE (val:Value {value: l.facility_name})
MERGE (attr)-[:OF_VALUE]->(val)
MERGE (l)-[:HAS]->(attr)
MERGE (l)-[:OF_VALUE]->(val)
MERGE (val)-[:REPRESENTS]->(name);  // Links Value to the Shared Name
```

✅ **What this does:**

- Links `Location` to `location_name` while ensuring it **points to the same `Name` entity**.
- The `Name` entity now connects both Facilities and Locations **with the same name**.

---

## **🔍 Querying Equivalent Names**

To **find Facilities and Locations that share the same name**, run:

```cypher
MATCH (e1)-[:OF_VALUE]->(v1)-[:REPRESENTS]->(n:Name)<-[:REPRESENTS]-(v2)<-[:OF_VALUE]-(e2)
WHERE id(e1) <> id(e2)
RETURN e1, e2, n;
```

✅ **This ensures that even if Facility and Location reference different attributes (`facility_name`, `location_name`), they are still treated as equivalent.**

## **🚀 Next Steps**

1. **Test the queries** in Neo4j.
2. **Verify shared names**:
    
    ```cypher
    MATCH (f:Facility)-[:OF_VALUE]->(v:Value)-[:REPRESENTS]->(n:Name)
    RETURN f, v, n LIMIT 10;
    ```
    
3. **Would you like to extend this model to other shared attributes, such as address or zip code?**

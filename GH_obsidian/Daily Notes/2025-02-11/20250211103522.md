Now that `facilities.csv` is updated, re-import the `Facility` nodes:

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Facility {
    facility_id: row.facility_id, 
    name: row.facility_name, 
    phone_number: row.phone_number, 
    type: row.facility_type, 
    operational_schedule: row.operational_schedule, 
    accepts_subsidies: row.accepts_subsidies
});

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///locations.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Location {location_id: row.location_id, city: row.city, state: row.state, zip_code: row.zip_code});

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///owners.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Owner {owner_id: row.owner_id, license_number: row.license_number, alternative_contact: row.alternative_contact_number});

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///licenses.csv' AS row
CREATE (:License {license_id: row.license_id, license_number: row.license_number, type: row.license_type, issue_date: row.license_issue_date, expiry_date: row.license_expiry_date});

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///school_districts.csv' AS row
CREATE (:SchoolDistrict {district_id: row.district_id, name: row.district_name});

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_location_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (l:Location {location_id: row.location_id})
MERGE (f)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l);

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_owner_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (o:Owner {owner_id: row.owner_id})
MERGE (f)-[:OWNED_BY]->(o);

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_license_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (lic:License {license_id: row.license_id})
MERGE (f)-[:HAS_LICENSE]->(lic);

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_school_district_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (sd:SchoolDistrict {district_id: row.district_id})
MERGE (f)-[:PART_OF_DISTRICT]->(sd);

```

Glad that worked! Hereâ€™s a **step-by-step** troubleshooting and fix process, along with the **exact commands** to ensure proper loading of data from CSV into **Neo4j**.

---

## **Step 1: Check CSV Formatting and Encoding**

First, ensure the CSV file is correctly formatted and encoded in **UTF-8**.

Run the following command:

```bash
file /var/lib/neo4j/import/facilities.csv
```

- If the output is **UTF-8**, continue.
- If not, convert it:
    
    ```bash
    iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 /var/lib/neo4j/import/facilities.csv -o facilities_utf8.csv
    ```
    

---

## **Step 2: Verify CSV Parsing in Neo4j**

Before creating nodes, **test if Neo4j reads the CSV properly**.

Run this Cypher query:

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
RETURN row LIMIT 5;
```

- If `row` values show `null`, **Neo4j is not reading the CSV correctly**.
- If values appear correctly, move to the next step.

---

## **Step 3: Check Column Names in CSV**

Ensure **column headers in your CSV match** the property names in your Cypher query.

Check the first few rows:

```bash
head -n 5 /var/lib/neo4j/import/facilities.csv
```

- If headers do **not match**, update your Cypher query accordingly.

To be sure, **explicitly print specific columns** in Neo4j:

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
RETURN row.facility_id, row.facility_name, row.phone_number, row.facility_type, row.operational_schedule, row.accepts_subsidies LIMIT 5;
```

- If any column returns `null`, **that column name does not match** the CSV header.

---

## **Step 4: Clear Existing Data (If Needed)**

If previous imports created **empty** or **incorrect** nodes, delete them:

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility) DETACH DELETE f;
```

This ensures that we **reload from scratch**.

---

## **Step 5: Reload Data into Neo4j**

Now, run the **corrected** Cypher query:

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Facility {
    facility_id: row.facility_id, 
    name: row.facility_name, 
    phone_number: row.phone_number, 
    type: row.facility_type, 
    operational_schedule: row.operational_schedule, 
    accepts_subsidies: row.accepts_subsidies
});
```

- This loads data into **Facility nodes**.

---

## **Step 6: Validate Data**

After loading, confirm that nodes **have properties**:

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility) RETURN f LIMIT 10;
```

If **properties are missing (`{}` empty object)**, it means:

1. Column names **don't match**.
2. Neo4j is treating **numbers as floats**.

---

## **Step 7: Ensure Phone Numbers Are Strings (Optional)**

Phone numbers in your CSV **end in `.0`**, meaning they are stored as floats.

To **force them into strings**, reload data using:

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Facility {
    facility_id: row.facility_id, 
    name: row.facility_name, 
    phone_number: toString(row.phone_number), 
    type: row.facility_type, 
    operational_schedule: row.operational_schedule, 
    accepts_subsidies: row.accepts_subsidies
});
```

---

## **Final Check: Query Data**

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility) RETURN f.facility_id, f.name, f.phone_number, f.type, f.operational_schedule, f.accepts_subsidies LIMIT 10;
```

âœ… **If data appears correctly, youâ€™re done!** ðŸš€

### **Recap of Key Fixes**

1. **Ensure UTF-8 encoding** (`iconv` if needed).
2. **Check if Neo4j can read CSV (`RETURN row LIMIT 5`)**.
3. **Ensure CSV headers match column names**.
4. **Delete old empty nodes (`MATCH (f:Facility) DETACH DELETE f;`)**.
5. **Reload using correct Cypher query**.
6. **Force numbers (phone) into strings (`toString(row.phone_number)`)**.

This workflow should **guarantee smooth imports** in the future. Let me know if you need further tweaks! ðŸš€

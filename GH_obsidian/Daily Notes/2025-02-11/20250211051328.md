## **5️⃣ Restore Facility Relationships**

Since we deleted all `Facility` nodes, we must **recreate relationships**:

### **🔗 Facility → Location**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_location_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (l:Location {location_id: row.location_id})
MERGE (f)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l);
```

### **🔗 Facility → Owner**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_owner_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (o:Owner {owner_id: row.owner_id})
MERGE (f)-[:OWNED_BY]->(o);
```

### **🔗 Facility → License**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_license_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (lic:License {license_id: row.license_id})
MERGE (f)-[:HAS_LICENSE]->(lic);
```

### **🔗 Facility → School District**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_school_district_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (sd:SchoolDistrict {district_id: row.district_id})
MERGE (f)-[:PART_OF_DISTRICT]->(sd);
```

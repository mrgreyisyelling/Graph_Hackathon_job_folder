Hereâ€™s the optimized code that **captures column names** when exporting the entity tables. This ensures that when you export the tables, the column names appear in the first row of the output.

### **ðŸ”§ Key Fixes & Improvements**

âœ… **Captures column names dynamically** for each table before exporting.  
âœ… **Exports CSV files with proper headers** (column names).  
âœ… **Uses `csv.writer` for clean and structured output**.  
âœ… **Avoids redundant database queries** by fetching table structures efficiently.

### **ðŸ’¡ Optimized Code for Exporting Entity Tables**

```python
import sqlite3
import csv

# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect("childcare.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# List of entity tables to export
tables = ["facilities", "locations", "owners", "licenses", "school_districts"]

# Directory to save CSV files
export_dir = "exports/"

# Ensure the export directory exists
import os
if not os.path.exists(export_dir):
    os.makedirs(export_dir)

# Export each table
for table in tables:
    # Fetch column names dynamically
    cursor.execute(f"PRAGMA table_info({table});")
    columns = [col[1] for col in cursor.fetchall()]

    # Fetch all rows from the table
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM {table};")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    # Define the export file path
    file_path = os.path.join(export_dir, f"{table}.csv")

    # Write data to CSV file
    with open(file_path, mode="w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(columns)  # Write header row
        writer.writerows(rows)  # Write table data

    print(f"Exported {table} to {file_path}")

# Close database connection
conn.close()
```

### **ðŸ“Œ How This Works**

1. **Connects to SQLite** and iterates through **each entity table**.
2. **Fetches column names dynamically** for each table using `PRAGMA table_info(table)`.
3. **Writes the column headers as the first row** in the CSV file.
4. **Writes all table data** after the headers.
5. **Saves each table as a CSV file** inside an `exports/` directory.

### **âœ… Example Output (`facilities.csv`)**

```
facility_id,facility_name,license_number,facility_address,phone_number,facility_type,operational_schedule,accepts_subsidies,location_id,owner_id,license_id,school_district_id
123abc,"ABC Daycare",56789,"123 Main St","555-1234","Daycare","Full-time","Yes",456def,789ghi,101jkl,202mno
456def,"XYZ Preschool",98765,"456 Elm St","555-5678","Preschool","Part-time","No",789ghi,101jkl,202mno,303pqr
```

This ensures that **all entity exports are structured correctly**.

### **ðŸš€ Next Steps**

- Run the script and check if all **CSV files** are generated correctly.
- If needed, modify the `export_dir` path to save to another location.
- Let me know if you need formatting adjustments or additional features! ðŸ”¥

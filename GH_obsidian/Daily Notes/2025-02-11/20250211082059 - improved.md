Got it! Since these nodes are **generated from scratch**, we will use `CREATE` instead of `MERGE` to ensure new nodes are inserted into the graph.

### **🔧 Key Updates**

✅ **Uses `CREATE` instead of `MERGE`** to insert new nodes.  
✅ **Ensures all properties from SQL tables are included**.  
✅ **Links Facilities to their respective Locations, Owners, Licenses, and School Districts**.

```
MATCH (f:Facility) DETACH DELETE f;
MATCH (l:Location) DETACH DELETE l;
MATCH (o:Owner) DETACH DELETE o;
MATCH (lic:License) DETACH DELETE lic;
MATCH (sd:SchoolDistrict) DETACH DELETE sd;

```

### **💡 Updated Cypher Script**

```cypher
// Load Locations
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///locations.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Location {
    location_id: row.location_id,
    location_name: row.location_name,
    location_address: row.location_address,
    city: row.city,
    state: row.state,
    zip_code: row.zip_code
});

// Load Owners
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///owners.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Owner {
    owner_id: row.owner_id,
    license_number: row.license_number,
    phone_number: row.phone_number,
    alternative_contact_number: row.alternative_contact_number
});

// Load Licenses
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///licenses.csv' AS row
CREATE (:License {
    license_id: row.license_id,
    license_number: row.license_number,
    license_type: row.license_type,
    license_issue_date: row.license_issue_date,
    license_expiry_date: row.license_expiry_date
});

// Load School Districts
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///school_districts.csv' AS row
CREATE (:SchoolDistrict {
    district_id: row.district_id,
    name: row.district_name
});

// Load Facilities and Link to Other Entities
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
CREATE (f:Facility {
    facility_id: row.facility_id,
    name: row.facility_name,
    facility_address: row.facility_address,
    phone_number: row.phone_number,
    license_number: row.license_number,
    type: row.facility_type,
    operational_schedule: row.operational_schedule,
    accepts_subsidies: row.accepts_subsidies
});


LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_location_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (l:Location {location_id: row.location_id})
MERGE (f)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l);

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_owner_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (o:Owner {owner_id: row.owner_id})
MERGE (f)-[:OWNED_BY]->(o);

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_license_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (lic:License {license_id: row.license_id})
MERGE (f)-[:HAS_LICENSE]->(lic);

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_school_district_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (sd:SchoolDistrict {district_id: row.district_id})
MERGE (f)-[:PART_OF_DISTRICT]->(sd);


MATCH (f:Facility)-[r]->(x) RETURN f, r, x LIMIT 10;
```


### old not needed?

``` python
// Link Facility to Location
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (l:Location {location_id: row.location_id})
CREATE (f)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l);

// Link Facility to Owner
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (o:Owner {owner_id: row.owner_id})
CREATE (f)-[:OWNED_BY]->(o);

// Link Facility to License
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (lic:License {license_id: row.license_id})
CREATE (f)-[:HAS_LICENSE]->(lic);

// Link Facility to School District
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (sd:SchoolDistrict {district_id: row.school_district_id})
CREATE (f)-[:PART_OF_DISTRICT]->(sd);
```

### **🔍 What’s Improved?**

1. **Uses `CREATE` for Fresh Data Generation**
    
    - Ensures **all nodes are newly created**.
    - No pre-existing data checks.
2. **Maintains Correct Relationships**
    
    - `(:Facility)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Location)`
    - `(:Facility)-[:OWNED_BY]->(:Owner)`
    - `(:Facility)-[:HAS_LICENSE]->(:License)`
    - `(:Facility)-[:PART_OF_DISTRICT]->(:SchoolDistrict)`

---

### **🚀 Next Steps**

✅ Run the script in **Neo4j Browser**.  
✅ Verify **data and relationships** using:

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility)-[r]->(x) RETURN f, r, x LIMIT 10;
```

✅ If needed, **add indexing** for faster queries:

```cypher
CREATE INDEX FOR (f:Facility) ON (f.facility_id);
CREATE INDEX FOR (l:Location) ON (l.location_id);
CREATE INDEX FOR (o:Owner) ON (o.owner_id);
CREATE INDEX FOR (lic:License) ON (lic.license_id);
CREATE INDEX FOR (sd:SchoolDistrict) ON (sd.district_id);
```

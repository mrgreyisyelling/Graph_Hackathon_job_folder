I bet you were waiting for me to say this - I think I might be just in over my head at the moment. 

I have to get ready to leave for EthDenver and I won't have the same focus this week. 

1. I got then broke the obsidian plugin. it was AI driven so lots of technical debt
2. image 1: this should be possible now. For a moment it worked yesterday. Basically the structure of the vault is encoded and uploaded to a server with a button press. This server collects a set of individual KGs places them in the same file space. A 'librarian' who manages the server (A knowledge farmer?), trims the branches and reduces the KG to a blockchain ready edition. Its written. 

3. This line of thinking and how does it connect to the 'economic union' that connects with Childcare, SW/NGO, and my real estate agenda.

4. And what hackathon? They can eat my triples. 

5. I am pacing in my office right now thinking hard how to land this. 

6. So I think the GRC-20 _standard_ (I think my brain missed that part) - we just create a coin to that standard, and that defines our knowledge graph 

Oh that ties into another thing.....

So  - I study/think hard about information movements and the development of information systems

Alright, let's break this down into **how people interact with the local information system** and **how their contributions form a knowledge graph** within Obsidian.

### **1. Who Are the Users?**

The community members include:

- **Local Renters & Homeowners** â€“ Looking for housing, repairs, and neighborhood updates.
- **Small Business Owners** â€“ Posting about their services, events, and job openings.
- **Job Seekers** â€“ Searching for work, gig economy jobs, or apprenticeships.
- **Activists & Organizers** â€“ Connecting people to community efforts, town halls, or advocacy events.
- **Shoppers & Sellers** â€“ Swapping goods, selling items, or bartering.
- **Service Providers** â€“ Offering childcare, cleaning, tech repair, tutoring, etc.
- **Local Government & Resources** â€“ Providing access to public services, utilities, and emergency information.

### **2. How Does Information Get Organized?**

In **Obsidian**, we need to structure information in a way that makes sense in a **Reddit/Craigslist-style** format while **leveraging a knowledge graph**.

- **General Area (Live Area)** â€“ Where ongoing, dynamic information is stored.
- **Import Area** â€“ Where structured datasets or outside info is processed before going live.
- **Export Area** â€“ Where snapshots of knowledge can be generated (e.g., RDF files, structured outputs).

### **3. What Kind of Topics are Created?**

- **Housing & Rentals**
    
    - Available apartments, roommates needed, landlord reviews.
    - Triples:
        - `Tenant -> lives in -> House on Leslie St`
        - `House on Leslie St -> has rent -> $900`
        - `Tenant -> looking for -> 2-bedroom apartment`
- **Jobs & Gigs**
    
    - Listings, skill-sharing, day labor connections.
    - Triples:
        - `John Doe -> offers -> Plumbing Services`
        - `Local CafÃ© -> hiring -> Barista`
        - `Mike -> looking for -> Computer Repair Help`
- **Buy/Sell/Trade**
    
    - Marketplace for furniture, appliances, books, tools.
    - Triples:
        - `Neighbor A -> selling -> Lawn Mower`
        - `Neighbor B -> looking for -> Used Bike`
        - `Local Artist -> offering -> Custom Portraits`
- **Events & Social**
    
    - Community meetings, parties, activism, mutual aid.
    - Triples:
        - `Food Co-op -> hosting -> Farmers Market`
        - `Community Member -> organizing -> Town Hall`
        - `Jazz Band -> performing at -> Local Bar`
- **Safety & Alerts**
    
    - Crime reports, weather, missing pets, neighborhood watch.
    - Triples:
        - `Storm -> causing -> Power Outage`
        - `Lost Dog -> last seen at -> Cedar St`
        - `Local Police -> issued -> Safety Alert`

### **4. How Do We Structure Notes and Triples?**

Each **post or listing** in the system is essentially **a note in Obsidian** that generates triples.

For example, a **rental listing** might be stored as:

#### **ðŸ“„ Note: "2BR Apartment for Rent - Hickory Street"**

```
---
entity: "2BR Apartment - Hickory Street"
live_version:
  Rent Price: "$900"
  Available From: "March 1st"
  Contact: "John Doe"
  Features:
    - "Washer/Dryer"
    - "Off-Street Parking"
  Status: "Active Listing"
  Listed By: "Jane (Landlord)"
---
```

**Triples Generated:**

- `2BR Apartment - Hickory Street -> Rent Price -> $900`
- `2BR Apartment - Hickory Street -> Available From -> March 1st`
- `2BR Apartment - Hickory Street -> Contact -> John Doe`
- `2BR Apartment - Hickory Street -> Features -> Washer/Dryer`
- `2BR Apartment - Hickory Street -> Listed By -> Jane (Landlord)`

This **creates relationships** between people, locations, jobs, listings, and objects in the community.

### **5. Whatâ€™s Next?**

1. **Build a Standardized Template** for each category (e.g., Housing, Jobs, Buy/Sell).
2. **Automate Triple Extraction** so that every new post in the vault updates the knowledge graph.
3. **Develop a System for Searching & Linking** within the community knowledge base.

This structure allows anyone in East Side Lansing to **contribute posts, make connections, and create a network of hyperlocal knowledge**.

What do you think? Should we start building templates for different categories, or do you want to refine the core structure first?

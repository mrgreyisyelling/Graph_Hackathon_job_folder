Awesome, so now we have **structured attributes** in YAML and **linked relationships** in Obsidian.

Here‚Äôs how we **expand & refine** this structure:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs Missing?**

- **Who** posted the note?
- **Expiration Dates** (for things like events, job listings, or housing availability).
- **Verification/Status** (Is this information community-verified? Trusted? Pending update?)
- **Engagement Signals** (How many people viewed/shared/liked it?)

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Standardizing YAML Attributes**

Let‚Äôs introduce a **universal YAML structure** where some fields apply across all note types:

```yaml
---
title: "[Title of the Note]"
type: "[Topic Type - Subtype]"
location: "[General Node or Local Landmark]"
posted_by: "[Username/Alias]"
posted_date: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
expires: "[YYYY-MM-DD / No Expiration]"
status: "[Active/Pending/Expired]"
verification: "[Self-Submitted / Community Verified / Business Verified]"
engagement: "[Views: # | Likes: # | Shares: #]"
tags: ["#RelevantTag1", "#RelevantTag2"]
---
```

This structure:

- **Ensures every note follows the same pattern.**
- **Includes community engagement & verification.**
- **Adds expiration to remove outdated listings.**

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Defining Expected Links Per Note**

- **Neighborhoods & Nodes** ‚Üí Every note ties to a place.
- **Related Topics** ‚Üí Certain topics naturally cluster together.
- **Community Boards** ‚Üí Where people will actually find this info.

Example for **Job Listings**:

```yaml
## Expected Links
- [[Neighborhood - [Eastside Lansing]]] ‚Üí General location  
- [[Bulletin Board - [Local Grocery Store]]] ‚Üí Where this job might be posted  
- [[Jobs & Gigs]] ‚Üí Parent category for all jobs  
- [[Housing - Roommates & Rentals]] ‚Üí If job seekers might need housing  
```

This builds **local context** into the **graph structure**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps: Automating This**

Now that we have:

1. **A Standardized YAML Schema**
2. **A Way to Connect Notes Dynamically**
3. **A Process for Different Note Types**

We can **write a script** to:

- Generate these **notes** programmatically.
- **Auto-link** related notes & nodes.
- Use **graph methods** to **analyze interactions**.

### üöÄ **What‚Äôs Next?**

- Do you want **a script** to **auto-create** these notes based on real Lansing locations & example submissions?
- Should we **simulate** a small community using this system to test it?

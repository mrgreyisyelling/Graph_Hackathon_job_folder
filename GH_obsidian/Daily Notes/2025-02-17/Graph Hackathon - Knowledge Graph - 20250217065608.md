Here are two **template structures** for specific **Types of Topics** within the **Topics** framework.

Each template defines:

1. **Standard Attributes** (expected fields)
2. **Expected Links** (related notes that should be connected)

Each **Type of Topic** will have a **consistent template** like this, ensuring that:

1. **Every note is structured the same way** (easy to read and parse).
2. **Related notes are always linked** (so users can navigate efficiently).
3. **Key attributes are standard** (so searches & filtering work well).

Would you like me to generate **templates for all Types of Topics** in this structured format? ðŸš€

### **Refining the Knowledge Graph Structure: A Localized Node System**

You're absolutely right‚Äîthis **isn't just about topics**. The **general area needs a node-based system** to create a **localized, durable structure** that organizes information **spatially and socially** rather than being tied to formal street addresses or external location data.

---

## **1. The "Node System" as the Backbone**

Instead of using fragile addresses, this **localized node system** organizes the **knowledge graph** around **community-anchored nodes**:

### **What are Nodes?**

Nodes represent **"common points of interaction"** in the community. These can be:

- **Corners & Street Communities** ‚Üí Recognized by locals, these are informal areas where people gather, do business, or share information.
    - _(e.g., "Cedar & MLK Corner", "Willow Street Market Spot")_
- **Business & Storefront Bulletin Boards** ‚Üí Inside shops, laundromats, libraries, or community centers, these physical locations hold flyers and local posts.
    - _(e.g., "Sunoco Gas Station Bulletin Board", "Lansing Public Library Community Board")_
- **Public Landmarks & Meeting Spots** ‚Üí Parks, transit stops, and key community locations where people interact.
    - _(e.g., "Reutter Park Hangout", "Allen Street Transit Stop")_
- **Social Hubs & People Networks** ‚Üí These are **not places** but **clusters of people** that self-identify, like local subcultures or mutual aid groups.
    - _(e.g., "East Side Musicians Collective", "Lansing Renters' Mutual Aid")_

These nodes form the **structural backbone** of the graph. Every **piece of information**‚Äîwhether a rental listing, job post, or community discussion‚Äî**gets linked to one or more nodes.**

---

## **2. Organizing Information Around Nodes**

### **Example 1: A Room for Rent Listing**

Instead of just "123 Hickory St," the note is **anchored to local nodes**:

üìÑ **Note: "Room for Rent - $600 - Willow Street Market Spot"**

```
---
entity: "Room for Rent - Willow Street Market Spot"
node: "Willow Street Market Spot"
live_version:
  Rent Price: "$600"
  Available From: "March 1st"
  Contact: "John Doe"
  Features:
    - "Washer/Dryer"
    - "Shared Kitchen"
  Status: "Active Listing"
  Listed By: "Jane (Landlord)"
---
```

üõ† **Generated Triples**:

- `Room for Rent -> linked to -> Willow Street Market Spot`
- `Room for Rent -> Rent Price -> $600`
- `Room for Rent -> Contact -> John Doe`
- `Room for Rent -> Features -> Washer/Dryer`

Here, the **physical address is irrelevant**‚Äîinstead, it‚Äôs **rooted in a node** that locals understand.

---

### **Example 2: A Gig Work Opportunity**

A contractor is offering work **at a known meetup location**:

üìÑ **Note: "Day Labor Needed - Roofing Help - Cedar & MLK Corner"**

```
---
entity: "Day Labor - Roofing Help - Cedar & MLK Corner"
node: "Cedar & MLK Corner"
live_version:
  Job Type: "Roofing"
  Pay: "$15/hr"
  Contact: "Mike the Contractor"
  Availability: "Saturday & Sunday"
---
```

üõ† **Generated Triples**:

- `Day Labor -> linked to -> Cedar & MLK Corner`
- `Day Labor -> Pay -> $15/hr`
- `Day Labor -> Contact -> Mike the Contractor`

Now, instead of a listing disappearing after a job is done, **future job posts at that node** can be connected, allowing workers to **track ongoing gigs** at this location.

---

## **3. The Topic Area: Deep Structure, Obsidian Links & Clusters**

Since we‚Äôre using **Obsidian‚Äôs natural linking system**, we **let folders and notes go deep** but also **enable emergent clustering**.

### **üìÇ Topic Structure in the Vault**

```
üìÇ General Area
   üìÇ Nodes
      üìÑ Cedar & MLK Corner
      üìÑ Willow Street Market Spot
      üìÑ Allen Street Transit Stop
      üìÑ Lansing Public Library Bulletin Board

üìÇ Community Topics
   üìÇ Housing
      üìÑ Room for Rent - Willow Street Market Spot
      üìÑ Studio Apartment - Allen Street Transit Stop
   üìÇ Jobs
      üìÑ Roofing Help - Cedar & MLK Corner
      üìÑ Caf√© Job - Hiring Barista
   üìÇ Events
      üìÑ Jazz Night - Local Bar
      üìÑ Renters‚Äô Meetup - Lansing Public Library
```

- **Every "node" has a permanent place in the vault** under **General Area ‚Üí Nodes**.
- **Community Topics (Housing, Jobs, Events, etc.) contain dynamic listings** that **link back** to their associated node.

### **üîó Example of Linkage**

In **Obsidian**, each listing in _Community Topics_ will have **internal links**:

üìÑ **"Room for Rent - Willow Street Market Spot"**

```
## üè° Room for Rent - $600
- üìç **Location**: [[Willow Street Market Spot]]
- üí∞ **Rent Price**: $600
- üìû **Contact**: John Doe
- üìÖ **Available From**: March 1st
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Active Listing
```

Now, when someone clicks on **"Willow Street Market Spot"**, they will **see every past and present listing linked to it.**

### **üî• How This Enables Clustering**

1. **A job-seeker checking Cedar & MLK Corner** will see **every past gig and contact info**.
2. **A new rental post at Lansing Public Library Bulletin Board** will **automatically be associated with past listings at the same node**.
3. **Events & recurring meetups** (e.g., musicians at a park, weekly free food events) **self-cluster over time**.

---

## **4. Expanding With Automation**

Once this foundation is built, we can:

4. **Automatically extract triples from notes**
    - `Person -> looking for -> Job at Cedar & MLK`
    - `Event -> happening at -> Lansing Public Library Bulletin Board`
5. **Enable live queries inside Obsidian** (showing ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening‚Äù at each node).
6. **Create an Export System** for visualizing clusters in external graph tools.

---

### **Final Questions Before We Build**

- **Do these node categories make sense?** (Are we missing a type?)
- **Would you like to experiment with a prototype structure in Obsidian first?**
- **What should the first "real" dataset look like?** (e.g., scraped Craigslist listings, community input?)

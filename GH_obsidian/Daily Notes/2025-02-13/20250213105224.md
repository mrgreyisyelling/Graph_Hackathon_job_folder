### **üîπ Organizing the DAO Membership & Functional Structure**

Each **agent is a union member** and belongs to one or more **subgroups**:

1. **Labor Pool (Default Membership)**
2. **Business Unit (BU)**
3. **Social Unit (SU)**
4. **Labor Union (LU) - Selects from the labor pool**

### **üìå Membership Rules**

‚úÖ **Everyone is part of the Labor Pool** (default, no dues required).  
‚úÖ **Joining BU or SU requires dues** (fewer people join as cost increases).  
‚úÖ **5% of people self-select into either BU or SU**, **1% into both**.  
‚úÖ **Only BU members can propose business deals**.  
‚úÖ **Proposals are discussed internally before submission to other units**.  
‚úÖ **Both LU & SU vote on contracts after a set discussion period**.  
‚úÖ **Proposal lead time: 2 days per 1 day of labor in the contract**.  
‚úÖ **Labor Pool assigns work based on skills & certification levels**.  
‚úÖ **Only permanent knowledge is written to the KG, everything else is metadata.**

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Assigning Membership in the Population Generator**

We update our **Python script** to:  
‚úÖ **Randomly assign 5% to BU, 5% to SU, and 1% to both**.  
‚úÖ **Track who is eligible to propose and vote on contracts**.  
‚úÖ **Mark members of the Labor Union (LU)**.

### **üìç Updated Python Script: Generating DAO Membership**

```python
import random
import pandas as pd

# Define possible roles
ROLES = ["Business Unit", "Social Unit", "Both", "None"]

# Membership allocation rules (5% BU, 5% SU, 1% Both, rest None)
def assign_unit():
    roll = random.random()
    if roll < 0.01:  
        return "Both"  # 1% of population joins both BU & SU
    elif roll < 0.06:  
        return "Business Unit"  # Next 5% join BU only
    elif roll < 0.11:  
        return "Social Unit"  # Next 5% join SU only
    else:
        return "None"  # Remaining 89% in Labor Pool only

# Placeholder functions for random values
def random_name():
    first_names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dana", "Eve", "Frank", "Grace", "Hank", "Ivy", "Jack"]
    last_names = ["Smith", "Johnson", "Williams", "Brown", "Jones", "Garcia", "Miller", "Davis", "Rodriguez", "Martinez"]
    return f"{random.choice(first_names)} {random.choice(last_names)}"

def random_age():
    return random.randint(18, 65)

def random_experience():
    return random.randint(0, 40)  # Years of experience

def random_skills():
    skills = ["Accounting", "Construction", "Childcare", "Logistics", "Marketing", "Management", "Finance", "Legal", "Plumbing", "Electrician"]
    return random.sample(skills, random.randint(1, 3))

# Generate 50 random people
population = []
for _ in range(50):
    membership = assign_unit()
    person = {
        "Name": random_name(),
        "Age": random_age(),
        "Experience (Years)": random_experience(),
        "Skills": ", ".join(random_skills()),
        "Membership": membership,
        "Can Propose Deals": membership in ["Business Unit", "Both"],
        "Can Vote on Deals": membership in ["Social Unit", "Both"]
    }
    population.append(person)

# Convert to DataFrame for easy viewing
df = pd.DataFrame(population)

# Display DataFrame
import ace_tools as tools
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="DAO Membership", dataframe=df)

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Organizing Business Proposals & Voting**

### **üìå Business Proposal Lifecycle**

1. **BU Members** propose deals internally.
2. **BU Members discuss before submitting** to LU & SU.
3. **LU & SU have a fixed discussion period (2 days per labor day).**
4. **Both LU & SU must vote "Yes" for approval**.
5. **If approved, contract moves to labor selection phase.**

---

### **üìç Smart Contract: Proposal Discussion & Voting**

This contract:  
‚úÖ **Allows BU members to submit proposals.**  
‚úÖ **Tracks voting from LU & SU.**  
‚úÖ **Ensures the correct lead time before approval.**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract ProposalVoting {
    struct Proposal {
        string jobTitle;
        uint256 laborDays;
        uint256 deadline;
        uint256 votesForLU;
        uint256 votesAgainstLU;
        uint256 votesForSU;
        uint256 votesAgainstSU;
        bool finalized;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    uint256 public proposalCounter;

    event ProposalSubmitted(uint256 proposalId);
    event ProposalVoted(uint256 proposalId, string unit, bool decision);
    event ProposalFinalized(uint256 proposalId, bool approved);

    function submitProposal(string memory _jobTitle, uint256 _laborDays) public {
        proposalCounter++;
        uint256 leadTime = _laborDays * 2 days;
        proposals[proposalCounter] = Proposal(_jobTitle, _laborDays, block.timestamp + leadTime, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
        emit ProposalSubmitted(proposalCounter);
    }

    function voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _unit, bool _decision) public {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        require(block.timestamp < proposal.deadline, "Voting period ended");

        if (keccak256(bytes(_unit)) == keccak256(bytes("LU"))) {
            if (_decision) proposal.votesForLU++;
            else proposal.votesAgainstLU++;
        } else if (keccak256(bytes(_unit)) == keccak256(bytes("SU"))) {
            if (_decision) proposal.votesForSU++;
            else proposal.votesAgainstSU++;
        }

        emit ProposalVoted(_proposalId, _unit, _decision);
    }

    function finalizeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) public {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        require(block.timestamp >= proposal.deadline, "Voting still active");
        require(!proposal.finalized, "Proposal already finalized");

        bool approved = (proposal.votesForLU > proposal.votesAgainstLU) && 
                        (proposal.votesForSU > proposal.votesAgainstSU);

        proposal.finalized = true;
        emit ProposalFinalized(_proposalId, approved);
    }
}
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Labor Pool & Skill Matching**

Once a contract is **approved**, the system:  
‚úÖ **Matches workers from the Labor Pool based on skills.**  
‚úÖ **Prioritizes certified workers first.**  
‚úÖ **Allows lateral moves based on metadata for skills without formal certification.**

### **üìç Matching Algorithm (Python)**

```python
def find_workers_for_job(required_skills, population):
    matched_workers = []
    for _, worker in population.iterrows():
        worker_skills = worker["Skills"].split(", ")
        if any(skill in worker_skills for skill in required_skills):
            matched_workers.append(worker["Name"])
    
    return matched_workers[:3]  # Select top 3 candidates

# Example job with required skills
job_skills = ["Construction", "Plumbing"]
workers = find_workers_for_job(job_skills, df)
print("Matched Workers:", workers)
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Future Enhancements**

‚úÖ **Allow skill-based lateral movements** for uncertified but experienced workers.  
‚úÖ **Automate worker selection from the Labor Pool based on ranking.**  
‚úÖ **Introduce performance tracking for future ranking.**

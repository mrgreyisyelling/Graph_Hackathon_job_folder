### **üîπ Structuring the DAO for Proposal Management & Business Coordination**

The system needs to **accept proposals and money into the system**, ensuring **businesses, labor, and social units negotiate their terms** while maximizing profits directed into **tokenized real estate assets**.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Proposal Flow & Economic Logic**

The **Business Unit (BU)** interacts with the outside world and is responsible for generating **job proposals**. These proposals define:

- **Job positions** (roles, required labor).
- **Pay structure** (how much labor and social units are compensated).
- **Social support** (childcare, transport, etc.).
- **Profit allocation** (how much goes to real estate assets).

üí° **The Social Unit (SU) and Labor Unit (LU) make demands, and negotiation occurs before a contract is finalized.**

### **üîπ Economic Objectives of Each Unit**

|**Unit**|**Goal**|
|---|---|
|**Business Unit (BU)**|Maximizes profit from deal, **funds job**, directs surplus into tokenized assets.|
|**Social Unit (SU)**|Tries to **extract resources** for social services, ensuring work is **efficient and sustainable**.|
|**Labor Unit (LU)**|Ensures **fair pay** for workers, balancing workload & compensation.|
|**Real Estate Asset (Tokenized Contract)**|Receives **a portion of social unit's excess**, accumulating long-term value.|

üìå **Laborers can also be part of the Business Unit**, but their primary focus is securing **jobs and resources**.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Contract System Breakdown**

We will design **three main contracts**:

|**Contract Name**|**Functionality**|
|---|---|
|**Proposal & Job Contract**|Handles **job proposals**, assigns labor & social roles.|
|**Escrow & Payment Contract**|Ensures **money is secured before work starts** and distributes funds.|
|**Tokenized Asset Contract**|Collects **profits from social units** and grows the real estate pool.|

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Proposal Lifecycle in the DAO**

The **proposal submission process** ensures all parties negotiate before work starts.

### **üìå Step 1: Proposal Submission**

- **BU submits a proposal**, defining:
    - **Job Roles** (how many positions, required skills).
    - **Wage Structure** (worker & social unit pay).
    - **Social Support** (childcare, transport, training).
    - **Profit Allocation** (how much goes into tokenized assets).
- Funds **must be locked in escrow** before the proposal is active.

### **üìå Step 2: Demand Submission**

- **Social Unit & Labor submit counteroffers**:
    - **Social Unit** demands **higher resources** for their services.
    - **Labor** negotiates **wages and job conditions**.
- DAO **balances the proposal** until all demands are met.

### **üìå Step 3: Contract Finalization**

- The **DAO approves the job proposal**, locking terms.
- Smart contract **secures payment in escrow**.
- Workers & social services **begin execution**.

### **üìå Step 4: Work Execution & Payment**

- Workers **complete their tasks**.
- Social units **provide necessary services**.
- **Funds are released**:
    - **Workers get paid**.
    - **Social unit keeps part of its revenue**.
    - **Excess funds from the social unit go into the tokenized asset contract**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Contract Design**

Let‚Äôs define the **core contract structures** for each phase.

### **üìç Proposal & Job Contract**

This contract **accepts job proposals**, tracks social & labor negotiations, and **finalizes agreements**.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract JobProposal {
    struct Proposal {
        address business;
        uint256 jobCount;
        uint256 workerPay;
        uint256 socialSupportPay;
        uint256 profitToAssets;
        bool finalized;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    uint256 public proposalCounter;

    event ProposalCreated(uint256 proposalId, address indexed business);
    event ProposalFinalized(uint256 proposalId);

    function createProposal(
        uint256 _jobCount,
        uint256 _workerPay,
        uint256 _socialSupportPay,
        uint256 _profitToAssets
    ) external {
        proposalCounter++;
        proposals[proposalCounter] = Proposal(msg.sender, _jobCount, _workerPay, _socialSupportPay, _profitToAssets, false);

        emit ProposalCreated(proposalCounter, msg.sender);
    }

    function finalizeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        require(!proposal.finalized, "Proposal already finalized");
        proposal.finalized = true;

        emit ProposalFinalized(_proposalId);
    }
}
```

---

### **üìç Escrow & Payment Contract**

Handles **funding and payment release** once jobs are completed.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract WorkEscrow {
    struct Job {
        address business;
        address worker;
        address socialUnit;
        uint256 workerPay;
        uint256 socialPay;
        uint256 profitToAsset;
        bool workerAccepted;
        bool supportAccepted;
        bool completed;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Job) public jobs;
    uint256 public jobCounter;

    event JobCreated(uint256 jobId, address indexed business);
    event JobCompleted(uint256 jobId);

    function createJob(address _worker, address _socialUnit, uint256 _workerPay, uint256 _socialPay, uint256 _profitToAsset) external payable {
        require(msg.value == _workerPay + _socialPay + _profitToAsset, "Insufficient funds");

        jobCounter++;
        jobs[jobCounter] = Job(msg.sender, _worker, _socialUnit, _workerPay, _socialPay, _profitToAsset, false, false, false);

        emit JobCreated(jobCounter, msg.sender);
    }

    function completeJob(uint256 _jobId) external {
        Job storage job = jobs[_jobId];
        require(job.workerAccepted && job.supportAccepted, "Job not fully accepted");

        job.completed = true;
        payable(job.worker).transfer(job.workerPay);
        payable(job.socialUnit).transfer(job.socialPay);
        payable(address(this)).transfer(job.profitToAsset);  // Send to real estate contract

        emit JobCompleted(_jobId);
    }
}
```

---

### **üìç Tokenized Asset Contract**

Receives **profit allocations from jobs**, representing **real estate assets**.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract RealEstateAsset {
    mapping(address => uint256) public assetBalance;

    event ProfitReceived(address indexed from, uint256 amount);

    function depositProfit() external payable {
        assetBalance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit ProfitReceived(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
}
```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps**

1. **Finalize DAO Voting Rules**
    
    - How does the DAO balance **business vs. labor vs. social unit demands**?
    - Do we implement **quadratic voting** or **stake-weighted voting**?
2. **Build Frontend Proposal Submission**
    
    - Create **forms for businesses to submit job proposals**.
    - Allow **workers & social units to counter-offer**.
3. **Develop Job Matching Logic**
    
    - Automate **worker & social unit assignments**.
    - Integrate with **Neo4j knowledge graph** for search.

### **üîπ What‚Äôs Next?**

- Do you want to **refine the DAO voting structure**, or should we **focus on frontend proposal submission first**? üöÄ

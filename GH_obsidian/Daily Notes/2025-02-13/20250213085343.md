### **🔹 Ensuring the Business Unit (BU) Accepts Work that Benefits the Union, Not Just Individual Managers**

The **Business Unit (BU)** will have **close relationships with outside businesses**, and **some labor & social unit members will be part of the BU**. This introduces **potential conflicts of interest**, where a **BU manager could prioritize deals benefiting their own external businesses** rather than deals benefiting the overall **union (the coordinated ecosystem of labor, social support, and tokenized assets).**

---

## **1️⃣ What Are the Risks?**

|**Risk**|**How It Can Happen**|**Potential Consequences**|
|---|---|---|
|**Self-Dealing**|A BU manager **accepts contracts from a business they own** at favorable terms.|Reduced wages or support services, hurting the ecosystem.|
|**Underpricing Work**|BU **accepts contracts that don't pay enough**, but still commits worker resources.|Workers do jobs that don't sustain the system long-term.|
|**Redirecting Profits**|BU **negotiates bad terms** for tokenized asset allocation.|The system lacks long-term funding stability.|
|**Favoring Specific Workers or Services**|BU **assigns work to insiders** instead of fair distribution.|Creates inequality in labor opportunities.|

📌 **The solution is to create mechanisms that align BU incentives with the collective good of the union.**

---

## **2️⃣ Governance Constraints to Keep BU Accountable**

We need **rules and smart contract constraints** that:

- **Prevent self-dealing.**
- **Ensure all deals provide sufficient pay for labor & social support.**
- **Enforce fair profit-sharing rules.**
- **Introduce voting mechanisms for transparency.**

### **🔹 Solutions**

|**Solution**|**How It Works**|**Who Enforces It?**|
|---|---|---|
|**Minimum Bid Pricing Rules**|Ensures BU only accepts work **above a defined wage floor**.|DAO smart contract auto-rejects low bids.|
|**Profit Share Enforced in Smart Contract**|**Fixed % of all deals** must go into **tokenized assets**.|Hardcoded in contract.|
|**Union Voting on Large Deals**|If a **contract is too large**, union members **must vote to approve it**.|DAO governance.|
|**Worker & SU Approval of Job Terms**|Before work starts, **labor & SU must agree to terms** (preventing bad jobs).|Decentralized worker voting.|
|**Whitelisted Business Contracts**|Businesses **must be approved** by the DAO before contracts can be accepted.|DAO-controlled business list.|

📌 **The DAO acts as the regulator, ensuring BU serves the broader interest of the union, not just individual members.**

## **3️⃣ Smart Contract Design for Governance Constraints**

Here’s how we enforce **job pricing, profit-sharing, and voting rules.**

### **📍 Business Contract Rules (Prevents Self-Dealing & Underpricing)**

Before a **BU can accept a contract**, we check:

- **Is the business whitelisted?**
- **Does the contract meet minimum wage standards?**
- **Does it allocate a required percentage to tokenized assets?**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract BusinessApproval {
    struct ContractProposal {
        address business;
        uint256 jobPay;
        uint256 supportPay;
        uint256 assetAllocation;
        bool approved;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => ContractProposal) public proposals;
    uint256 public proposalCounter;
    mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedBusinesses;

    event ProposalCreated(uint256 proposalId, address indexed business);
    event ProposalApproved(uint256 proposalId);

    modifier onlyWhitelisted(address _business) {
        require(whitelistedBusinesses[_business], "Business not approved");
        _;
    }

    function whitelistBusiness(address _business) external {
        whitelistedBusinesses[_business] = true;
    }

    function createProposal(
        uint256 _jobPay,
        uint256 _supportPay,
        uint256 _assetAllocation
    ) external onlyWhitelisted(msg.sender) {
        require(_jobPay > 1 ether, "Minimum job pay requirement not met"); // Ensures fair wages
        require(_assetAllocation >= (_jobPay + _supportPay) / 10, "Insufficient asset allocation");

        proposalCounter++;
        proposals[proposalCounter] = ContractProposal(msg.sender, _jobPay, _supportPay, _assetAllocation, false);

        emit ProposalCreated(proposalCounter, msg.sender);
    }

    function approveProposal(uint256 _proposalId) external {
        ContractProposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        require(!proposal.approved, "Already approved");

        proposal.approved = true;
        emit ProposalApproved(_proposalId);
    }
}
```

---

### **📍 Worker & SU Voting on Job Terms**

Before a **job starts**, labor and SU members **must accept the contract terms** to prevent **underpricing or exploitation**.

```solidity
contract JobApproval {
    struct Job {
        uint256 proposalId;
        address worker;
        address socialUnit;
        bool workerAccepted;
        bool supportAccepted;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Job) public jobs;
    uint256 public jobCounter;

    event JobCreated(uint256 jobId);
    event WorkerAccepted(uint256 jobId);
    event SupportAccepted(uint256 jobId);

    function createJob(uint256 _proposalId, address _worker, address _socialUnit) external {
        jobCounter++;
        jobs[jobCounter] = Job(_proposalId, _worker, _socialUnit, false, false);

        emit JobCreated(jobCounter);
    }

    function acceptJob(uint256 _jobId) external {
        Job storage job = jobs[_jobId];
        require(msg.sender == job.worker, "Only assigned worker can accept");
        job.workerAccepted = true;

        emit WorkerAccepted(_jobId);
    }

    function acceptSupport(uint256 _jobId) external {
        Job storage job = jobs[_jobId];
        require(msg.sender == job.socialUnit, "Only assigned support can accept");
        job.supportAccepted = true;

        emit SupportAccepted(_jobId);
    }
}
```

## **4️⃣ DAO Oversight for Large Contracts**

If a contract is **large enough** (e.g., **above a certain budget**), the **union must vote** before BU can accept it.

### **📍 DAO Voting for Large Deals**

- If a deal is **above 100 ETH**, **union members vote** on whether BU can accept it.
- Prevents **individual managers from approving risky or biased deals**.

```solidity
contract DAOApproval {
    struct Deal {
        address business;
        uint256 value;
        uint256 votesFor;
        uint256 votesAgainst;
        bool finalized;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Deal) public deals;
    uint256 public dealCounter;

    event DealProposed(uint256 dealId);
    event VoteCast(uint256 dealId, bool inFavor);
    event DealFinalized(uint256 dealId, bool approved);

    function proposeDeal(uint256 _value) external {
        require(_value >= 100 ether, "Only large deals require voting");
        dealCounter++;
        deals[dealCounter] = Deal(msg.sender, _value, 0, 0, false);

        emit DealProposed(dealCounter);
    }

    function voteOnDeal(uint256 _dealId, bool inFavor) external {
        require(!deals[_dealId].finalized, "Deal already finalized");

        if (inFavor) {
            deals[_dealId].votesFor++;
        } else {
            deals[_dealId].votesAgainst++;
        }

        emit VoteCast(_dealId, inFavor);
    }

    function finalizeDeal(uint256 _dealId) external {
        Deal storage deal = deals[_dealId];
        require(!deal.finalized, "Already finalized");

        deal.finalized = true;
        bool approved = deal.votesFor > deal.votesAgainst;

        emit DealFinalized(_dealId, approved);
    }
}
```

## **5️⃣ Finalizing the Oversight System**

### **🔹 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Whitelisted Businesses Only** → No external businesses can manipulate deals.  
✅ **Minimum Wage Enforcement** → Prevents lowball contracts.  
✅ **Worker & SU Voting** → Ensures fairness in job allocation.  
✅ **Large Deals Require Union Voting** → DAO governance prevents BU self-dealing.

📌 **The combination of smart contract rules, voting oversight, and financial controls ensures BU cannot act solely for personal gain.**

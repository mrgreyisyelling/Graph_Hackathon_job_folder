Ok so proposal is formally entered the KG of the group. The KG references all the parts as metadata, This allows common and fixed reference by the group. Every new draft is entered into the KG as a new point - the group chooses the draft to write to memory and certify

Each draft creates a discussion board that takes comments from both union representatives and from members in general

If there is agreement and the draft is accepted, The draft is converted into common knowledge and placed in the Group KG. From this point of agreement, all groups organize their resources.

The unions select individual based on internally determined and agreed upon standards - following a similar standard as coming to an agreement aobut the proposal.

These individuals are selected and all the necessary social support organized for them, meeting the standards the group sets for itself.

To meet these needs means drawing from the labor pool - That means in the membership of the labor union, there needs to be the skill sets, capabilities and experience to meet the labor needs of both the business and social units.

So part of the logic needs to be that members have to be registered and their skill sets recorded and registered where appropriate.

### **üîπ Refining the Process: Proposal Certification, Discussion, Workforce Selection & Skill Registry in the Knowledge Graph (KG)**

Now that **each proposal draft is stored in the KG**, we need a **structured process** for:

‚úÖ **Recording all parts of the proposal as metadata for a common reference**  
‚úÖ **Tracking drafts** ‚Äì each draft is an individual record, and the **final agreed-upon version is "written to memory"**  
‚úÖ **Creating a discussion board** for **union representatives & general members**  
‚úÖ **Certifying the proposal as "common knowledge" once consensus is reached**  
‚úÖ **Selecting workers & social support services** based on agreed standards  
‚úÖ **Ensuring the labor pool has the skills necessary to meet the work & social support needs**

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Process Breakdown**

### **üìå Step 1: Proposal Drafting & Metadata Storage**

- Each **draft proposal** is written as a **new node in the KG**.
- The KG **tracks all parts of the proposal** (job details, pay, social support, labor allocation).
- The group **chooses the draft** to become the official agreement.

### **üìå Step 2: Proposal Discussion Board**

- Each **proposal creates a discussion board**.
- **Union representatives** & **general members** can **comment, suggest changes, or approve**.
- Once the **discussion reaches consensus**, the draft **is finalized**.

### **üìå Step 3: Certification as Common Knowledge**

- The **finalized proposal is moved into the Group KG as ‚Äúcertified‚Äù**.
- **This is now the official reference point** for labor & social support organization.
- No further edits can be made without a **new revision cycle**.

### **üìå Step 4: Selecting Workers & Organizing Social Support**

- **Each union selects individuals** based on **agreed-upon internal standards**.
- The selected individuals **must meet the labor & support needs** outlined in the proposal.
- **All social support (childcare, transport, etc.) is organized** accordingly.

### **üìå Step 5: Labor Pool Registration & Skill Tracking**

- Each **worker in the union has a skill registry**.
- **Skill sets, certifications, experience, and availability are stored in the KG**.
- When workers are needed, the **system automatically finds qualified candidates**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Knowledge Graph Structure for Proposals, Discussions & Worker Registry**

Each proposal and workforce selection will be **tracked in the KG** using **Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) triples**.

üìå **Proposal Metadata (Drafts & Certification Process)**

```
(PROPOSAL-123) -[:HAS_DRAFT]-> (DRAFT-1)
(PROPOSAL-123) -[:HAS_DRAFT]-> (DRAFT-2)
(PROPOSAL-123) -[:HAS_DISCUSSION]-> (DISCUSSION-BOARD-456)
(PROPOSAL-123) -[:CERTIFIED_AS]-> (COMMON_KNOWLEDGE)
```

üìå **Discussion Board & Comments**

```
(DISCUSSION-BOARD-456) -[:HAS_COMMENT]-> (COMMENT-789)
(UNION-REP-321) -[:MADE_COMMENT]-> (COMMENT-789)
(MEMBER-999) -[:MADE_COMMENT]-> (COMMENT-790)

üìå **Finalizing the Agreement**

üìå **Selecting Workers & Social Support**

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Contract Implementation**

We need **three smart contracts**:

1. **Proposal & Discussion Contract** ‚Äì Manages proposal drafts, discussions, and certification.
2. **Workforce Selection Contract** ‚Äì Allows union representatives to select workers & support services.
3. **Skill Registry Contract** ‚Äì Tracks worker skills, certifications, and experience.

---

### **üìç Proposal & Discussion Smart Contract**

This contract: ‚úÖ **Stores drafts** on-chain.  
‚úÖ **Links discussion boards** to each proposal.  
‚úÖ **Allows union members to comment**.  
‚úÖ **Certifies a proposal when consensus is reached**.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract ProposalDiscussion {
    struct Proposal {
        string jobTitle;
        uint256 workerPay;
        uint256 supportPay;
        uint256 assetAllocation;
        bool certified;
    }

    struct Comment {
        address commenter;
        string message;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    mapping(uint256 => Comment[]) public discussions;
    uint256 public proposalCounter;

    event ProposalCreated(uint256 proposalId);
    event CommentAdded(uint256 proposalId, address commenter, string message);
    event ProposalCertified(uint256 proposalId);

    function createProposal(
        string memory _jobTitle,
        uint256 _workerPay,
        uint256 _supportPay,
        uint256 _assetAllocation
    ) public {
        proposalCounter++;
        proposals[proposalCounter] = Proposal(_jobTitle, _workerPay, _supportPay, _assetAllocation, false);
        emit ProposalCreated(proposalCounter);
    }

    function addComment(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _message) public {
        discussions[_proposalId].push(Comment(msg.sender, _message));
        emit CommentAdded(_proposalId, msg.sender, _message);
    }

    function certifyProposal(uint256 _proposalId) public {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        proposal.certified = true;
        emit ProposalCertified(_proposalId);
    }
}
```

### **üìç Workforce Selection Contract**

This contract: ‚úÖ **Stores worker skill sets**.  
‚úÖ **Allows union representatives to select workers & social support**.  
‚úÖ **Ensures selected workers meet the proposal‚Äôs needs**.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract WorkforceSelection {
    struct Worker {
        string name;
        string[] skills;
        uint256 experienceYears;
        bool selected;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Worker) public workers;
    uint256 public workerCounter;

    event WorkerRegistered(uint256 workerId, string name);
    event WorkerSelected(uint256 workerId);

    function registerWorker(string memory _name, string[] memory _skills, uint256 _experienceYears) public {
        workerCounter++;
        workers[workerCounter] = Worker(_name, _skills, _experienceYears, false);
        emit WorkerRegistered(workerCounter, _name);
    }

    function selectWorker(uint256 _workerId) public {
        Worker storage worker = workers[_workerId];
        require(!worker.selected, "Worker already selected");
        worker.selected = true;
        emit WorkerSelected(_workerId);
    }
}
```

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ User Flow**

4. **Proposal Drafting & Discussion**
    
    - BU submits a **proposal draft**.
    - A **discussion board is created**, and members **comment**.
    - If there is **agreement**, the draft is **certified**.
5. **Proposal Becomes Common Knowledge**
    
    - Certified **proposals are stored permanently in the KG**.
    - This serves as **the foundation for labor & social support organization**.
6. **Workforce Selection & Skill Registry**
    
    - **Workers & social services are selected** based on the certified proposal.
    - Labor Union members **must have necessary skills in the registry**.
7. **Job Execution Begins**
    
    - All **selected individuals are assigned to work**.
    - **Escrow contracts are funded** and the **work begins**.

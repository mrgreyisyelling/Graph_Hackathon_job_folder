So I need to create the structure of this dapp. First I need to add people to the membership, and do all the blockchain related actions associated with that. Then I need to have a system to accept business proposals, and all the blockchain related to that Then I need a system for labor and social to vote I need a list of all the forms and back end logic pages, and points of transaction between the program the database, etc. I need a check list so I can draw it out and then I work out what needs to be worked on

## **📝 Drawing Out the DApp**

Now that we have **all components outlined**, you can:  
🖍️ **Sketch the full system flow:**

- **Users & Permissions** (Who does what?)
- **Transaction Flow** (How does data move between frontend, backend, blockchain, & KG?)
- **Decision Points** (Voting, Work Matching, Payments)

---

## **🚀 Next Steps**

Would you like to:  
1️⃣ **Build the Membership System First?**  
2️⃣ **Start with Business Proposal Processing?**  
3️⃣ **Develop the Voting Mechanism?**

🚀 **Which part do you want to work on next?**

I see the diagram is coming together well—it maps out the flow from **membership registration** to **proposal submission, voting, worker selection, and final approval/payment** into escrow. It looks like the **Knowledge Graph (KG)** integration is structured to translate and store key events as **triples** at each stage.

### **🔹 What’s Missing or Needs Completion?**

1. **Voting Outcomes Handling:**
    
    - If **approved**, it moves to **worker selection** and escrow.
    - If **rejected**, what happens? Is it discarded, or can it be revised?
    - Does **revision require a new submission, or can proposals be modified?**
2. **Worker Selection & Matching Flow:**
    
    - How are workers pulled from the **labor database**?
    - Are skill matching & certification levels considered?
    - Do workers get an option to **accept or decline** jobs?
3. **Final Approval & Payment System:**
    
    - Once a job is filled, how does the **business unit confirm execution?**
    - Does **payment enter escrow first, or does it happen after approval?**
    - How does the **KG track job completion and payment fulfillment?**

---

### **🔹 Next Steps to Complete This Diagram**

✅ **Add rejection/feedback flow after voting.**  
✅ **Clarify worker selection process—how workers & skills are matched.**  
✅ **Define final approval steps before escrow payment.**

### **📌 How Do You Want to Proceed?**

1️⃣ **Do you want to keep sketching & filling in missing details?**  
2️⃣ **Or should we start building out specific components like proposal submission?**

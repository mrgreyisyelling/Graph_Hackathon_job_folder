### **🛠 Smart Contract Design for Coordinating Business, Social Units, and Labor**

We need a **smart contract system** that ensures:

1. **Funds are secured before work starts.**
2. **Payments flow correctly** between businesses, labor, and social support.
3. **Escrow ensures trust** in transactions.

---

## **1️⃣ Smart Contract Roles**

The **three primary parties** involved:

|**Role**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Business Unit (BU)**|Funds the job, pays for both direct work and necessary social support (e.g., childcare).|
|**Social Unit (SU)**|Provides support services (e.g., daycare, transportation, training).|
|**Labor Unit (LU)**|The worker(s) performing the primary job.|
|**Incoming Business Financing (IBF)**|Ensures businesses have enough liquidity before a job is assigned.|

---

## **2️⃣ Smart Contract Logic**

The contract needs to **manage the entire workflow**:

4. **Business Unit (BU) submits a job**:
    
    - BU deposits **funds into escrow** to pay for work and social support.
    - The job is posted and awaits worker confirmation.
5. **Workers & Social Support Lock In**:
    
    - A **worker (LU) accepts** the job.
    - A **social service (SU) confirms** availability (e.g., daycare provider confirms they can cover working hours).
    - At this point, **all roles are filled, and work is scheduled**.
6. **Escrow Secures the Payment**:
    
    - If **all confirmations** are made, funds are **locked in escrow**.
    - If financing was external, the **incoming financing provider (IBF)** ensures availability.
7. **Work is Completed**:
    
    - LU completes the job.
    - SU provides required support.
8. **Payment Distribution**:
    
    - Payment is released from escrow **to LU and SU**.
    - BU is charged accordingly.
    - If any disputes arise, funds remain locked until resolved.

## **3️⃣ Smart Contract Structure**

We'll design **two core contracts**:

### **1️⃣ Work Escrow Contract**

Handles **fund security and payment release**.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract WorkEscrow {
    struct Job {
        address business;
        address worker;
        address socialUnit;
        uint256 workPayment;
        uint256 supportPayment;
        bool workerAccepted;
        bool supportAccepted;
        bool completed;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Job) public jobs;
    uint256 public jobCounter;

    event JobCreated(uint256 jobId, address indexed business);
    event JobAccepted(uint256 jobId, address indexed worker);
    event SupportAccepted(uint256 jobId, address indexed socialUnit);
    event JobCompleted(uint256 jobId);

    function createJob(address _worker, address _socialUnit, uint256 _workPayment, uint256 _supportPayment) external payable {
        require(msg.value == _workPayment + _supportPayment, "Insufficient escrow funds");

        jobCounter++;
        jobs[jobCounter] = Job(msg.sender, _worker, _socialUnit, _workPayment, _supportPayment, false, false, false);

        emit JobCreated(jobCounter, msg.sender);
    }

    function acceptJob(uint256 _jobId) external {
        Job storage job = jobs[_jobId];
        require(msg.sender == job.worker, "Not the assigned worker");
        require(!job.workerAccepted, "Job already accepted");

        job.workerAccepted = true;
        emit JobAccepted(_jobId, msg.sender);
    }

    function acceptSupport(uint256 _jobId) external {
        Job storage job = jobs[_jobId];
        require(msg.sender == job.socialUnit, "Not the assigned support");
        require(!job.supportAccepted, "Support already accepted");

        job.supportAccepted = true;
        emit SupportAccepted(_jobId, msg.sender);
    }

    function completeJob(uint256 _jobId) external {
        Job storage job = jobs[_jobId];
        require(job.workerAccepted && job.supportAccepted, "Job not fully accepted");
        require(msg.sender == job.business, "Only business can confirm completion");

        job.completed = true;
        payable(job.worker).transfer(job.workPayment);
        payable(job.socialUnit).transfer(job.supportPayment);

        emit JobCompleted(_jobId);
    }
}
```

---

### **2️⃣ Financing & DAO Governance Contract**

If external financing is used, this contract:

- Approves funding requests.
- Monitors capital reserves.
- Interacts with DAO governance.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract BusinessFinance {
    mapping(address => uint256) public creditBalance;
    mapping(address => bool) public approvedBusinesses;

    event CreditIssued(address indexed business, uint256 amount);
    event CreditUsed(address indexed business, uint256 amount);

    modifier onlyApproved() {
        require(approvedBusinesses[msg.sender], "Not an approved business");
        _;
    }

    function approveBusiness(address _business) external {
        approvedBusinesses[_business] = true;
    }

    function issueCredit(address _business, uint256 _amount) external {
        require(approvedBusinesses[_business], "Business not approved");
        creditBalance[_business] += _amount;
        emit CreditIssued(_business, _amount);
    }

    function useCredit(address _business, uint256 _amount) external onlyApproved {
        require(creditBalance[_business] >= _amount, "Insufficient credit");
        creditBalance[_business] -= _amount;
        emit CreditUsed(_business, _amount);
    }
}
```

## **4️⃣ Next Steps**

9. **Test Work Escrow Contract**
    
    - Deploy on a local blockchain.
    - Simulate creating a job, having a worker/social unit accept, and executing payments.
10. **Integrate with Frontend**
    
    - UI should allow businesses to **post jobs** and fund escrow.
    - Workers and support units should **accept jobs**.
11. **Implement DAO Governance**
    
    - Determine **who manages business financing approval**.
    - Implement a **voting mechanism for funding**.

✅ **Created Business Finance Contract** to handle external funding.  
✅ **Defined next steps** for testing, integration, and governance.

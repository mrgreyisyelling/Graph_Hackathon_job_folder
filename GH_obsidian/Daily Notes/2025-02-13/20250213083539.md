### **üõ† Structuring the DAO for Coordinating Work, Finance, and Social Services**

The DAO's primary role is **coordinating resources** between businesses, workers, and social support services. Since the **goal is coordination**, we need to ensure the DAO has **decision-making power over funding, job creation, and economic flows**.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Functions of the DAO**

|**Function**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|**Govern Business Finance**|Control funding for businesses, ensuring liquidity.|
|**Approve Job Contracts**|Validate new work agreements before funds are locked.|
|**Oversee Profit Distribution**|Allocate earnings between businesses, workers, and social units.|
|**Resolve Disputes**|Handle contract failures, refunds, and misallocation of funds.|
|**Control Tokenized Real Estate**|Manage asset-backed financing models.|

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ DAO Architecture & Governance Model**

To effectively manage coordination, the DAO should be structured with **two main governance layers**:

### **üìå Governance Layers**

1. **Economic Coordination Layer**
    
    - Controls **funding, job approvals, and profit-sharing rules**.
    - Uses **governance tokens (GOV) for voting**.
    - Includes **business, worker, and social unit representatives**.
2. **Operational Execution Layer**
    
    - Handles **day-to-day contract execution**.
    - Uses **smart contracts to enforce decisions**.
    - Includes **automated escrow, job management, and credit systems**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ DAO Governance Model**

### **üîπ Who Votes?**

To balance control, we‚Äôll use **quadratic or weighted voting**:

|**Voter Group**|**Voting Power**|
|---|---|
|**Business Units (BU)**|Vote on job financing, payment rules.|
|**Social Units (SU)**|Vote on support service funding and coordination.|
|**Workers (LU)**|Vote on job contract terms and dispute resolution.|
|**Investors/Financers (IF)**|Vote on liquidity and credit issuance.|

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Contracts for DAO Execution**

To **automate coordination**, the DAO relies on **smart contracts** that enforce rules **without manual intervention**.

### **üìç DAO Governance Contract**

- **Manages voting and proposal execution**.
- **Controls treasury** (funding pool for job financing).
- **Oversees all coordination rules**.

### **üìç Business Credit Contract**

- **Allocates credit** based on DAO decisions.
- **Prevents overspending or underfunding**.

### **üìç Escrow & Job Execution Contract**

- **Handles job lifecycle** from funding to payment release.
- **Ensures DAO-approved work agreements** are enforced.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ DAO Proposal Lifecycle**

The DAO follows a **proposal-based system** for managing work and finances.

1. **Proposal Creation**
    
    - BU submits a **job financing request**.
    - SU submits a **support funding request**.
2. **Voting Phase**
    
    - DAO members vote to **approve/reject funding**.
3. **Contract Execution**
    
    - If approved, smart contracts **lock funds and enforce work agreements**.
4. **Work Completion & Payment**
    
    - Upon job completion, **funds are automatically released**.
5. **Dispute Handling (if needed)**
    
    - DAO arbitrates **conflicts over payments, work quality**.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Token Model for DAO Incentives**

To encourage participation, the DAO can issue **utility and governance tokens**.

|**Token Type**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|**Governance Token (GOV)**|Voting power in DAO decisions.|
|**Work Token (WORK)**|Used to **pay for jobs and social services**.|
|**Real Estate Token (RE)**|Tied to **asset-backed financing** models.|

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps**

6. **Refine DAO Voting Model**
    
    - Choose **quadratic vs. weighted voting**.
    - Define **token staking rules**.
7. **Design DAO Smart Contracts**
    
    - Governance contract.
    - Business credit issuance.
    - Treasury & job financing.
8. **Integrate DAO With Job System**
    
    - Connect DAO voting with **job funding approvals**.
    - Automate **work contract execution**.

### **üîπ What‚Äôs Next?**

- Should we start by **building the governance contract**?
- Or refine **business credit & funding allocation first**? üöÄ

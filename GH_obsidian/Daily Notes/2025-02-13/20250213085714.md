### **üîπ Structuring the DAO to Prevent Self-Dealing & Ensure Market-Normal Deals**

We now have **two key governance rules** for **ensuring fairness** in Business Unit (BU) deal-making:

1. **Self-Dealing Prevention**
    
    - **Anyone personally benefiting from a deal cannot vote on it** (conflict-of-interest exclusion).
    - **Their voting power is delegated to others.**
2. **Market-Normality Enforcement**
    
    - **The deal must meet market standards** (fair pricing, wage floors, and proper cost allocations).
    - **If both Social Unit (SU) and Labor Unit (LU) agree the deal is fair, it must be good enough.**
    - **Undisclosed secondary benefits to the BU operator do not matter as long as the deal meets these conditions.**

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Dealing Prevention: How Voting Delegation Works**

üìå **If a BU member has an external interest in a deal, they must remove themselves from voting.**

‚úÖ **How This Works in Practice**

- If a **BU member is connected to an outside business involved in the deal**, they **must abstain from voting.**
- **Their votes are redistributed to other DAO members automatically.**
- This **prevents manipulation** while maintaining **fair representation.**

### **üìç Smart Contract: Automatic Vote Delegation**

When a **BU member abstains**, **their voting power is reassigned**.

        proposals[proposalCounter] = Proposal(msg.sender, _value, 0, 0, false);
        emit ProposalCreated(proposalCounter);
    }

    function delegateVote(address _to) external {
        require(_to != msg.sender, "Cannot delegate to self");
        delegateVotes[msg.sender] = _to;
        emit VoteDelegated(msg.sender, _to);
    }

    function voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool inFavor) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        require(!proposal.voted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        require(!proposal.finalized, "Proposal finalized");

        address voter = delegateVotes[msg.sender] != address(0) ? delegateVotes[msg.sender] : msg.sender;

        if (inFavor) {
            proposal.votesFor++;
        } else {
            proposal.votesAgainst++;
        }

        proposal.voted[msg.sender] = true;

    function finalizeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) external {

        require(!proposal.finalized, "Already finalized");

        proposal.finalized = true;
        bool approved = proposal.votesFor > proposal.votesAgainst;

        emit ProposalFinalized(_proposalId, approved);
    }
}

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Market-Normality Enforcement: Ensuring Deals Are Fair**

**üìå The Rule:**

- If both **LU (workers) and SU (social unit) agree the deal is fair**, the deal is automatically accepted.
- If the **BU operator has a hidden side deal**, it **doesn't matter** as long as the negotiated contract meets standards.
- **This ensures work is properly priced, wages are fair, and support services are covered.**

### **üîπ How to Check if a Deal is Market-Normal?**

|**Check**|**How It's Enforced**|
|---|---|
|**Minimum Wage & Support Costs**|The contract **must meet defined floor prices** (hardcoded in the contract).|
|**Profit Allocation Rules**|**A fixed % must go to tokenized assets** (ensuring sustainability).|
|**Worker & Social Unit Agreement**|If both LU & SU **approve**, the deal is accepted **without extra voting needed**.|

### **üìç Smart Contract: Market-Normality Check**

This **ensures all deals meet market standards before execution**.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract MarketNormality {
    struct JobDeal {
        address business;
        uint256 workerPay;
        uint256 supportPay;
        uint256 assetAllocation;
        bool workerApproved;
        bool supportApproved;
        bool finalized;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => JobDeal) public deals;
    uint256 public dealCounter;

    event DealCreated(uint256 dealId);
    event WorkerApproved(uint256 dealId);
    event SupportApproved(uint256 dealId);
    event DealFinalized(uint256 dealId);

    function createDeal(
        uint256 _workerPay,
        uint256 _supportPay,
        uint256 _assetAllocation
    ) external {
        require(_workerPay >= 1 ether, "Below wage floor");
        require(_supportPay >= 0.5 ether, "Insufficient social support");
        require(_assetAllocation >= (_workerPay + _supportPay) / 10, "Asset allocation too low");

        dealCounter++;
        deals[dealCounter] = JobDeal(msg.sender, _workerPay, _supportPay, _assetAllocation, false, false, false);
        emit DealCreated(dealCounter);
    }

    function approveWorker(uint256 _dealId) external {
        JobDeal storage deal = deals[_dealId];
        deal.workerApproved = true;
        emit WorkerApproved(_dealId);
    }

    function approveSupport(uint256 _dealId) external {
        JobDeal storage deal = deals[_dealId];
        deal.supportApproved = true;
        emit SupportApproved(_dealId);
    }

    function finalizeDeal(uint256 _dealId) external {
        JobDeal storage deal = deals[_dealId];
        require(deal.workerApproved && deal.supportApproved, "Both parties must approve");

        deal.finalized = true;
        emit DealFinalized(_dealId);
    }
}

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Coordination: Bringing It All Together**

### **How This Governance System Works Step-by-Step**

1. **A business deal is proposed.**
2. **BU operators connected to the deal must abstain from voting** (votes delegated).
3. **DAO members vote on large deals** (ensuring fairness).
4. **Workers (LU) and Social Unit (SU) approve the job offer**.
5. **If the job is fair & meets market norms, it's automatically accepted.**
6. **Funds are locked in escrow, and work begins.**

üìå **With these rules in place, BU cannot game the system without providing value to the union.**

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Finalizing the DAO Rules**

To fully define the **DAO‚Äôs power balance**, we need to finalize:

1. **Who gets to vote?**
    - Weighted voting? Quadratic? One-person-one-vote?
2. **How do we ensure transparency?**
    - Public transaction records? Smart contract audits?
3. **How do we incentivize participation?**
    - DAO governance tokens? Rewards for fair dealmaking?

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps**

Would you like to:

4. **Refine the DAO voting system further** (e.g., how governance tokens work)?
5. **Develop a UI for business deal submission & voting**?
6. **Work on dispute resolution rules (handling failed jobs, refunds)?**

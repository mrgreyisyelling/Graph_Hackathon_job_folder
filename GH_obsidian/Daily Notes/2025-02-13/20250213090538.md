### **üîπ Defining the Process to Accept a Contract for Consideration**

To ensure **transparency, fairness, and efficiency**, we need a **structured process** for contract proposals, review, and approval.

üìå **Key Goals of the Process:**  
‚úÖ Ensure **proposals are properly evaluated** before execution.  
‚úÖ Allow **BU, SU, and LU to negotiate terms before committing**.  
‚úÖ Prevent **self-dealing and unfair contracts**.  
‚úÖ Ensure deals **meet market norms** before being accepted.  
‚úÖ Automate the process as much as possible using smart contracts.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Contract Acceptance Workflow**

### **üìå Step 1: Business Unit (BU) Submits a Proposal**

- BU submits a **job contract** proposal.
- The contract includes:
    - Job roles, worker pay, social support funding.
    - Asset allocation (portion allocated to tokenized real estate).
    - Expected contract duration & terms.
- **Contract must meet market-normal conditions.**

### **üìå Step 2: Market-Normality Check**

- The system **automatically verifies** that:
    - **Worker pay is above the wage floor.**
    - **Social support funding is sufficient.**
    - **A fixed % of the contract value is allocated to long-term assets.**
- **If the contract fails these checks, it is rejected immediately.**

### **üìå Step 3: Worker & Social Unit Consideration**

- **Labor Unit (LU)** reviews job details and **approves or requests changes.**
- **Social Unit (SU)** reviews the social support terms and **approves or requests changes.**
- **If both LU & SU approve, the contract moves forward.**

### **üìå Step 4: DAO Final Consideration**

- If a contract **meets all conditions**, it can be **automatically accepted**.
- If the contract **exceeds a certain size (e.g., 100 ETH+), DAO members vote** before finalizing.
- **Self-dealing rule applies:**
    - BU members **with a conflict of interest must abstain**.
    - Their **voting power is reassigned to others.**

### **üìå Step 5: Smart Contract Execution**

- Once **approved, funds are locked in escrow**.
- Work **begins**, and payments **are released upon completion**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Contract Implementation**

We need **two key contracts** to manage the **proposal process & voting system**.

### **üìç Contract Proposal Submission**

This contract ensures: ‚úÖ **Only valid businesses can submit proposals.**  
‚úÖ **Deals must meet market standards before moving forward.**  
‚úÖ **Worker & SU approval is required before execution.**

    struct Proposal {
        address business;
        uint256 workerPay;
        uint256 socialSupportPay;
        uint256 assetAllocation;
        bool workerApproved;
        bool supportApproved;
        bool finalized;
    }

    ) external {
        require(_workerPay >= 1 ether, "Below wage floor");
        require(_socialSupportPay >= 0.5 ether, "Insufficient social support");
        require(_assetAllocation >= (_workerPay + _socialSupportPay) / 10, "Asset allocation too low");

        proposalCounter++;
        proposals[proposalCounter] = Proposal(msg.sender, _workerPay, _socialSupportPay, _assetAllocation, false, false, false);
        
        emit ProposalCreated(proposalCounter);
    }

    function approveWorker(uint256 _proposalId) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        proposal.workerApproved = true;
        emit WorkerApproved(_proposalId);
    }

    function approveSupport(uint256 _proposalId) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        proposal.supportApproved = true;
        emit SupportApproved(_proposalId);
    }

    function finalizeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        require(proposal.workerApproved && proposal.supportApproved, "Both parties must approve");

        proposal.finalized = true;
        emit ProposalFinalized(_proposalId);
    }
}

### **üìç DAO Voting on Large Contracts**

This contract ensures: ‚úÖ **Deals above a threshold require DAO approval.**  
‚úÖ **Self-dealing rules apply (conflicted members must abstain).**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract DAOVoting {
    struct Deal {
        address proposer;
        uint256 value;
        uint256 votesFor;
        uint256 votesAgainst;
        mapping(address => bool) voted;
        bool finalized;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Deal) public deals;
    mapping(address => address) public delegateVotes;
    uint256 public dealCounter;

    event DealProposed(uint256 dealId);
    event VoteDelegated(address indexed from, address indexed to);
    event VoteCast(uint256 dealId, address voter, bool inFavor);
    event DealFinalized(uint256 dealId, bool approved);

    function proposeDeal(uint256 _value) external {
        require(_value >= 100 ether, "Only large deals require voting");
        dealCounter++;
        deals[dealCounter] = Deal(msg.sender, _value, 0, 0, false);

        emit DealProposed(dealCounter);
    }

    function delegateVote(address _to) external {
        require(_to != msg.sender, "Cannot delegate to self");
        delegateVotes[msg.sender] = _to;
        emit VoteDelegated(msg.sender, _to);
    }

    function voteOnDeal(uint256 _dealId, bool inFavor) external {
        Deal storage deal = deals[_dealId];
        require(!deal.voted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        require(!deal.finalized, "Deal finalized");

        address voter = delegateVotes[msg.sender] != address(0) ? delegateVotes[msg.sender] : msg.sender;

        if (inFavor) {
            deal.votesFor++;
        } else {
            deal.votesAgainst++;
        }

        deal.voted[msg.sender] = true;
        emit VoteCast(_dealId, voter, inFavor);
    }

    function finalizeDeal(uint256 _dealId) external {
        Deal storage deal = deals[_dealId];
        require(!deal.finalized, "Already finalized");

        deal.finalized = true;
        bool approved = deal.votesFor > deal.votesAgainst;

        emit DealFinalized(_dealId, approved);
    }
}
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Full Contract Review & Execution Flow**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Business Unit submits a contract proposal**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Market-normality check ensures fair wages & asset allocation**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Worker (LU) and Social Unit (SU) review & approve**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **If the contract is large, DAO members vote** (self-dealing rule applies).

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Upon job completion, payments are released**.

üìå **This guarantees transparency, fair wages, and financial sustainability for the union.**

Would you like to:

1. **Refine DAO voting rules further?** (How votes are weighted)
2. **Work on UI for proposal submission & voting?**

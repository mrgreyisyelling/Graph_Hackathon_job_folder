OK lets organize the membership of the DAO and how each part works.

Each agent is a member of the union. The union has three parts - business, social and labor. Everyone is part of labor pool, but there is a labor union that picks from the pool. People can self select into the business if they pay dues to the business unit. People can selfselect into the social unit- if they pay dues to the social unit.  So not everyone does this, the more expensive it gets, the less they do it.

So initially, only have 5% of the population be members of any group and 1% members of the all.

we want the structure to handle 100% and unlimited membership for all groups, but assume those functional numbers.

So Business unit people can bring in and propose business deals

other business unit people can discuss it before showing it to the other units

Each of those unit can talk freely and at a set time, a vote has to be submitted to pass it by both or the proposal is rejected. Every proposal needs a lead time of 2 days of every 1 day of labor in the contract.

So we then to fill the roles of that contract. 

We have people with random experiences, that may or maynot be formal. We need to have ways of talking about it and basically pair people with tasks. 

When people are placing their skills in the KG - there are different levels of certified. Anything that isn't permanent knowledge isn't written. Its meta data otherwise. 

So when the labor poor attempts to broaden and broaden its net to move people into jobs, it knows how to laterally do this.

### **üîπ Organizing the DAO Membership & Functional Structure**

Each **agent is a union member** and belongs to one or more **subgroups**:

1. **Labor Pool (Default Membership)**
2. **Business Unit (BU)**
3. **Social Unit (SU)**
4. **Labor Union (LU) - Selects from the labor pool**

### **üìå Membership Rules**

‚úÖ **Everyone is part of the Labor Pool** (default, no dues required).  
‚úÖ **Joining BU or SU requires dues** (fewer people join as cost increases).  
‚úÖ **5% of people self-select into either BU or SU**, **1% into both**.  
‚úÖ **Only BU members can propose business deals**.  
‚úÖ **Proposals are discussed internally before submission to other units**.  
‚úÖ **Both LU & SU vote on contracts after a set discussion period**.  
‚úÖ **Proposal lead time: 2 days per 1 day of labor in the contract**.  
‚úÖ **Labor Pool assigns work based on skills & certification levels**.  
‚úÖ **Only permanent knowledge is written to the KG, everything else is metadata.**

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Assigning Membership in the Population Generator**

We update our **Python script** to:  
‚úÖ **Randomly assign 5% to BU, 5% to SU, and 1% to both**.  
‚úÖ **Track who is eligible to propose and vote on contracts**.  
‚úÖ **Mark members of the Labor Union (LU)**.

---

### **üìç Updated Python Script: Generating DAO Membership**

```python
import random
import pandas as pd

# Define possible roles
ROLES = ["Business Unit", "Social Unit", "Both", "None"]

# Membership allocation rules (5% BU, 5% SU, 1% Both, rest None)
def assign_unit():
    roll = random.random()
    if roll < 0.01:  
        return "Both"  # 1% of population joins both BU & SU
    elif roll < 0.06:  
        return "Business Unit"  # Next 5% join BU only
    elif roll < 0.11:  
        return "Social Unit"  # Next 5% join SU only
    else:
        return "None"  # Remaining 89% in Labor Pool only

# Placeholder functions for random values
def random_name():
    first_names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dana", "Eve", "Frank", "Grace", "Hank", "Ivy", "Jack"]
    last_names = ["Smith", "Johnson", "Williams", "Brown", "Jones", "Garcia", "Miller", "Davis", "Rodriguez", "Martinez"]
    return f"{random.choice(first_names)} {random.choice(last_names)}"

def random_age():
    return random.randint(18, 65)

def random_experience():
    return random.randint(0, 40)  # Years of experience

def random_skills():
    skills = ["Accounting", "Construction", "Childcare", "Logistics", "Marketing", "Management", "Finance", "Legal", "Plumbing", "Electrician"]
    return random.sample(skills, random.randint(1, 3))

# Generate 50 random people
population = []
for _ in range(50):
    membership = assign_unit()
    person = {
        "Name": random_name(),
        "Age": random_age(),
        "Experience (Years)": random_experience(),
        "Skills": ", ".join(random_skills()),
        "Membership": membership,
        "Can Propose Deals": membership in ["Business Unit", "Both"],
        "Can Vote on Deals": membership in ["Social Unit", "Both"]
    }
    population.append(person)

# Convert to DataFrame for easy viewing
df = pd.DataFrame(population)

# Display DataFrame
import ace_tools as tools
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="DAO Membership", dataframe=df)
```

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Organizing Business Proposals & Voting**

### **üìå Business Proposal Lifecycle**

1. **BU Members** propose deals internally.
2. **BU Members discuss before submitting** to LU & SU.
3. **LU & SU have a fixed discussion period (2 days per labor day).**
4. **Both LU & SU must vote "Yes" for approval**.
5. **If approved, contract moves to labor selection phase.**

---

### **üìç Smart Contract: Proposal Discussion & Voting**

This contract:  
‚úÖ **Allows BU members to submit proposals.**  
‚úÖ **Tracks voting from LU & SU.**  
‚úÖ **Ensures the correct lead time before approval.**

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract ProposalVoting {
    struct Proposal {
        string jobTitle;
        uint256 laborDays;
        uint256 deadline;
        uint256 votesForLU;
        uint256 votesAgainstLU;
        uint256 votesForSU;
        uint256 votesAgainstSU;
        bool finalized;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    uint256 public proposalCounter;

    event ProposalSubmitted(uint256 proposalId);
    event ProposalVoted(uint256 proposalId, string unit, bool decision);
    event ProposalFinalized(uint256 proposalId, bool approved);

    function submitProposal(string memory _jobTitle, uint256 _laborDays) public {
        proposalCounter++;
        uint256 leadTime = _laborDays * 2 days;
        proposals[proposalCounter] = Proposal(_jobTitle, _laborDays, block.timestamp + leadTime, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
        emit ProposalSubmitted(proposalCounter);
    }

    function voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _unit, bool _decision) public {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        require(block.timestamp < proposal.deadline, "Voting period ended");

        if (keccak256(bytes(_unit)) == keccak256(bytes("LU"))) {
            if (_decision) proposal.votesForLU++;
            else proposal.votesAgainstLU++;
        } else if (keccak256(bytes(_unit)) == keccak256(bytes("SU"))) {
            if (_decision) proposal.votesForSU++;
            else proposal.votesAgainstSU++;
        }

        emit ProposalVoted(_proposalId, _unit, _decision);
    }

    function finalizeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) public {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
        require(block.timestamp >= proposal.deadline, "Voting still active");
        require(!proposal.finalized, "Proposal already finalized");

        bool approved = (proposal.votesForLU > proposal.votesAgainstLU) && 
                        (proposal.votesForSU > proposal.votesAgainstSU);

        proposal.finalized = true;
        emit ProposalFinalized(_proposalId, approved);
    }
}
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Labor Pool & Skill Matching**

Once a contract is **approved**, the system:  
‚úÖ **Matches workers from the Labor Pool based on skills.**  
‚úÖ **Prioritizes certified workers first.**  
‚úÖ **Allows lateral moves based on metadata for skills without formal certification.**

### **üìç Matching Algorithm (Python)**

```python
def find_workers_for_job(required_skills, population):
    matched_workers = []
    for _, worker in population.iterrows():
        worker_skills = worker["Skills"].split(", ")
        if any(skill in worker_skills for skill in required_skills):
            matched_workers.append(worker["Name"])
    
    return matched_workers[:3]  # Select top 3 candidates

# Example job with required skills
job_skills = ["Construction", "Plumbing"]
workers = find_workers_for_job(job_skills, df)
print("Matched Workers:", workers)
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Future Enhancements**

‚úÖ **Allow skill-based lateral movements** for uncertified but experienced workers.  
‚úÖ **Automate worker selection from the Labor Pool based on ranking.**  
‚úÖ **Introduce performance tracking for future ranking.**

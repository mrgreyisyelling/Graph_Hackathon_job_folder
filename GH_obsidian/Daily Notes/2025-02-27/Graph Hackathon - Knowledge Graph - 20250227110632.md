    Hi, I'm still trying to locate the rpc url for the geogenesis testnet so I can add it to my wallet to view the testnet tokens and run the ops but I can't seem to find it anywhere. And its not in the .env.example file. I need some help.

    It's string encoded. '1' or '0'
    
17. ### _[_2:13 PM_]_Yaniv_:_¬†
    
    We decided it was better for consistency to have all the native types string encoded. For numbers, it helps with precision. Checkbox is the only one where it takes more space for minimal additional value, but it's not really that much space.

    Yes totally. That's the beauty of a property graph model. I wouldn't do it to prevent cluttering of the entities main page.. I would do it if the intent is to describe facts about the working relationship between Ruth and the supreme court. In this case, all the properties on the relation are about her working relationship, so I think that's the correct modeling.

    @Yaniv So, under the law subspace, should I create a Courts and Judges Subspaces? Then each of the courts / judges are uploaded to their respecive sub space type and make those entities type Judge or Court Space types. So each judge / court would have their own space? Courts having their own subspace makes sense because all the court cases that are heard by that court could be published to that subspace. Then in the Judges subspace, I could publish all of their opinions and link those opinions to the related court case. Does that structure make sense? Then should each court case have its own subspace? Because I could then link all the oral arguments to that court case (publishing them to the subspace for that case?

    @Yaniv So, under the law subspace, should I create a Courts and Judges Subspaces? Then each of the courts / judges are uploaded to their respecive sub space type and make those entities type Judge or Court Space types. So each judge / court would have their own space? Courts having their own subspace makes sense because all the court cases that are heard by that court could be published to that subspace. Then in the Judges subspace, I could publish all of their opinions and link those opinions to the related court case. Does that structure make sense? Then should each court case have its own subspace? Because I could then link all the oral arguments to that court case (publishing them to the subspace for that case? Really just wondering how deeply subspaces should be used over just general entities? (edited)
    
    ### _[_2:16 PM_]_Yaniv_:_¬†
    
    It does make sense. I am curious if that will overly fragement the governance of those spaces though. As more people participate in Geo, we'll want to have many spaces for lots of things. But until we have a critical mass of users, fragmenting into too many spaces will make it harder to get to a critical mass of usage. I wonder if we should keep all the court related info in one space, and all the judge related info in another space for now. And as the space gets used by more and more people, things can get split up into subspaces and content can be moved into those subspaces.

    ### _[_2:18 PM_]_JourneyinJew_:_¬†
    
    Sounds good. I will only structure those two as subspaces. Also, to create a subspace, do you just regularly create a space and then relate it to another space as a Types relation. Thats what it appears is done on mainnet. But wanted to make sure there wasnt a seperate publishing method for deploying a subspace.
    
54. ### _[_2:19 PM_]_Yaniv_:_¬†
    
    Yep that's right. You can add any existing space as a subspace of another space after the fact

    @byron the result of fuzzySearch is an array of entity name matches with their ids, but there‚Äôs no way to determine the entity type. I want to check if a specific type already exists before creating new entities, and if it doesn‚Äôt, create it How can I solve this issue? Can we extend the search API to also return the entity types? (edited)

    Support for fuzzy searching the mainnet knowledge graph is available now. By default the fuzzy search API will now query the mainnet knowledge graph by default. If you want to query the testnet knowledge graph you'll need to add a query parameter to denote testnet. The `hackathon-template` repo has been updated to show searching both knowledge graphs.
    
    ``export async function fuzzySearch(searchTerm: string): Promise<Result[]> {     // Will search Mainnet by default     const response = await fetch(`https://api-testnet.grc-20.thegraph.com/search?q=${searchTerm}`);      // Add network=TESTNET if you want to search testnet     const response = await fetch(`https://api-testnet.grc-20.thegraph.com/search?q=${searchTerm}&network=TESTNET`);      const { results } = await response.json();     return results; }``

    IPFS doesn't return a transaction hash, since it isn't a blockchain. It returns a CID. You then have to submit a transaction using wallet.sendTransaction like this https://github.com/geobrowser/grc-20-recipes/blob/main/examples/publish.ts#L15

    This is great. But I'm a bit confused, are we using the original hackathon-template or the grc-20-ts library. I had some errors using the original template so I just stuck with the grc20ts. Any advice for best practice? Thanks.
    
78. ### _[_5:28 AM_]_nikgraf_:_¬†
    
    @ezra_kewa Can you let us know which errors you ran into? Then we can investigate an fix them. In general the template [https://github.com/geobrowser/hackathon-template/](https://github.com/geobrowser/hackathon-template/ "https://github.com/geobrowser/hackathon-template/") uses the grc-20-ts library. That said end of last week we added more high level utility functions to create properties, types and entities with relations These are not yet used/documented in the template. So in general the template is a good start, but we recommend to use the new functionalities we are building into the GRC-20-ts lib

    @ezra_kewa Can you let us know which errors you ran into? Then we can investigate an fix them. In general the template https://github.com/geobrowser/hackathon-template/ uses the grc-20-ts library. That said end of last week we added more high level utility functions to create properties, types and entities with relations These are not yet used/documented in the template. So in general the template is a good start, but we recommend to use the new functionalities we are building into the GRC-20-ts lib

    @nikgraf hey Nik, this is a screenshot of the error I get when I try to transpile my deploy-space.ts file to deploy-space.js using npx tsc: I think the error has to do with different versions of JS/TS but I'm not sure.

    Hello everyone
    
147. @PaulieB
    
    I put this in wallet.ts `export const account = { address: process.env.WALLET_ADDRESS, async sendTransaction(tx: { to: string; value: bigint; data: string; maxFeePerGas?: bigint; maxPriorityFeePerGas?: bigint; gasLimit?: bigint }) { try { // Use fixed gas values for testing const gasLimit = '0x7A120'; // 500,000 const gasPrice = '0x2540BE400'; // 10 gwei console.log('\n[Transaction] Using fixed gas values:', { gasLimit, gasPrice });`

    We're working on the Geo Genesis network, and networks aren't connected. The ETH is on Sepolia, but how am I supposed to use Sepolia ETH for transactions on Geo Genesis? That makes no sense to me. As far as I know, ETH on one network can't be used on another. Maybe my logic is flawed and I don‚Äôt understand Web3 that well, but this seems completely wrong. async function checkBalance() { const address = "0x068c3199C444b82FB7959d0784C37b3271D30E5D"; const balance = await publicClient.getBalance({ address }); console.log("Balance (in wei):", balance); console.log("Balance (in ETH):", Number(balance) / 1e18); } And BTW, I did try lowering the gas but my balance is still 0. The ETH is on a different network, that's what I don't understand. (edited)

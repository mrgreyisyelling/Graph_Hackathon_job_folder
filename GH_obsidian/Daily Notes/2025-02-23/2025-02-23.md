Today - we are going to create a script to upload to the GRC-20 space 


## In the office

- Reload the data - make sure you are able to structure the data as you need it
- Define the entities - using the recipe, create triples and prep the data into IPFS
	- look at the data before you send it to the testnet
- Once you create the entities, create the relationships between them.
- As part of this process you need to do three separate things:
	- Create a local list of 'entities', attributes, and relationships.
	- You need to turn each one of these into an ID'ed element - and keep a record of that relationship
- Generate types (clusters of attributes)

Well, the way I think about it is that you want everything that can be point to something else to be pointing to something else. But everything that cant be can be text. Using your example: It seems obvious that the author should be pointing to an entity that was created for that author. That will allow the authors information to be filled in by you (or at a later date) and still be connected to that paper that they wrote. Publisher should also be pointing to an entity created to represent that specific pubisher But, for title, I dont see where you could point that to (assuming this is coming from the entity created for the paper), so I would just make that one text. Description would also be text. Then for URL, I would just use one of the properties already created for a URL like website. You will use the ID for that as the attribute ID, then in your value set the value type to be "URL" and pass the value as text. It should then show on Geo as a hyperlink. Again for date, there are specific properties already created that should work. If not, you may need to create some unique ones. For example, I htink I am going to have to create a unique property for date of birth and date of death because they dont already exist. I will probably just copy the start date property set up when I do that. Hopefully that helps answer some of your question.

Ok I have the  code necessary to  serve the hackathon served up. I need to do their steps but we are getting there.

I want to breka the project down into modules and start developing each module in a visable manner.

Module one:
General material to global knowldge graph (hackathon)

M2: Local knowledge collection systems

1. front end linked
	1. process through which bootstrapped form can rpodce and concentrate knowledge locally. 
	2. process through which that knowledge is stored and shared.
2. EU syste
	1. what is the dao system and how is it managed
	2. what is the mechanism of the union
	3. how is the LB distinct from the union and how are they interlinked
	4. how is the data collected and handled
	5. how is tthe dat sold and how is that handled
	6. how is the data found and how is that handled.

![[Graph Hackathon - Knowledge Graph - 20250225062537 2025-02-25 19.26.42.excalidraw]]


each part of this system has to be modeled, and broken down.

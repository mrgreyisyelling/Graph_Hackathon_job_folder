If you are receiving this email, its because I believe you have something to contribute. If it isn't obvious to you, enough to want to take action for the purposes of joining this process or refining the mission, feel no pressure or social expectation.

The goal of project spaceman is to protect and concentrate the world's common knowledge, and ensure that all 8 billion people and their social contribution to the over all system is honored. 

This means making sure the local systems exist to collect and utilize local knowledge freely - ensuring its quality and its accuracy. The system created, must be uniquely and locally created in a manner deemed socially valuable/meaningful in local terms. the systems they use and develop locally are capable of being reproduced globally for the same purpose. 

The purpose is to ensure that every community has the ability to uniquely represent and organize itself, to ensure fair and efficient organization of labor and resources, relative to the community's local definition.

Project spaceman hopes to create and structure a colonizing kit - capable of captures and channeling the raw, existing social energy into these systems. to ensure the maximum amount of diversity in the system, at stage 1 levels. Project Spaceman is about creating and defining these stage 1 locals.

Stage 1 locales are built on ground truth. 

the purpose is to create systems of hyper-local independent knowledge systems, capable of providing proximate and local networks of relation the ability to interact locally and publicly.

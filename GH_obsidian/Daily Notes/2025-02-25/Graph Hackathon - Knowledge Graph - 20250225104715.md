Hello, my name is Michael Penta.

I am a social engineer, and I have worked for the last 7 years as a landlord. Before this I was a social scientist studying social networks, urban poverty, and the formation of groups from dyadic events. 

I am not PhD. I am ABD. PhDs are for pussies - if you need one or want one, there is something wrong with you. I both needed and wanted one, so I was not worthy. I carry this shame like a nerd carries his pride. I try to avoid having to explain it to people. 

This project is an extention of what would have been my dissertation. My work and the direction I wanted to take my work (stubbornly) was stopped by a lack of technology in the very area the:

chainlnk
the graph
Ocean Protocol

work. I could amorphize some of the ideas I had, because I was already looking at the type of hashing crypto was doing, and I was aware of crypto, but my mind was coming from a different place. I couldn't figure it out, it was out of my realm. 

I am ready to do this work. I am hoping the by having a hand in the formation of the roots of these systems, there will be more and more frequent opportunities to gather knowledge  from them. 

I want to build the systems necessary to collect that information in a rational, logical, and consistent manner across systems and across communities, to describe close proximate social systems. 

There are a million, innaccurate ways to express this, I have chosen this way because it seems to be appropriate. The things I have attached to it, I do so because I think it makes sense. I have exactly the level of qualifications that a dude like me does in a situation like this.

Tread carefully. And quietly.

------------------------------------------


The system that I am sharing with you is designed to be a modular tool, capable of being utilized in any number of social situations. In the same way a laser can measure the contours of a room, this tool is step one of doing that socially.

What we are looking at is the dongle that is going to connect reality to this digital realm. We want to have it be cheap and as low key as possible, so everyone can learn to use it creatively and aggressively. Why?

1) Information systems must be, at their core democratic. Every, individual, contributes something meaningful to an information system. It is essential that we control the levers of power at the most base level and the knowledge of how to do this are universal. Standardizing a low tech system to create 'base' 'knowledge graphs' by encouraging and undermining more complex and sophisticated systems currently being used, and the steps necessary to harvest that knowledge and refine it for general use. Immediately creating local marketplaces designed to represent systems of knowledge, where this knowledge can be searched for, requested, and utilized by other knowledge systems - in a manner directly controlled by the community beneath the refiner. So the refiner and the populus remain in sync against outside requests for information, to maximize capitalization. I want to see this happen, universally - I want to see local communities to make it expensive as fuck to get access to this information, and I want to see local communities to have free, profitable access to it.
2) To maintain this democracy - we have to leverage the physicality of knowledge and infromation and make it difficult for non-local actors to have discounted/free access to local information, and maximize the amount of outside wealth these non-local actors must contribute.
3) This will result in the ticktok-ification of locations, in the same way that it did videos, as certain things gather attention. We can't control that but we have to design controls that protect locals from unnecessary noise. So the controls on these systems - to be democratic, have be local and direct. The community in an area must be able to control, fully, what and how their local information space behaves, the one that they share. Any disagreements of that information space is resolved in that space, as part of its business. If a community wants to allow the tick-tok-ification of their world, there is nothing that can stop them. But the community will not be exploitable, directly.
4) Parallel, competitive, knowledge systems, must have a way to coexist, locally. Not winner take all. The only way to guarantee that is to ensure that 'the common' space is always rooted in the physical space, everyone has common access to. Therefore, systems much be built to enable this.
5) At its core - the system has to draw information in, and tie it to a space. So a system must exist to draw in localized information that is not directly connected to the digital system itself. This means, media and methods that are designed to provide a standard method of reaching information needs that are low/no-tech, but need reliable distribution. We want a system that is capable of pulling in extremely localized/raw information, that can then be filtered upward and distributed appropriately.
6) Local, centralization, prior to refinement and global distribution has value. First it helps clarify in a way no other source will be able to. Second, it ensures the opportunity for local competition to arise. Making sure the design is tooled to work this close the to ground level, ensures that development can be recreated. We want to see local standards to arise and the tools and expertise to manage it to arise with it.
7) It gives people confidence that - if a crime of collection and distribution occurs, it occurs locally. Its reason to believe then, a local information refiner will be an important role for legal reasons as well.


So at this point, I have given you an a system of data collection and a localized 'watcher' curating the local information.

Lets extend this. 


This 'local data collector' is actually a local dao, we are going to call an Economic Union. It represents a localized system designed to help unify the population in the 'local network' to form local, direct, face to face relationships. 

This is system is an abstraction of a local system of exchange. The idea of union, is meant to start first with the idea of pooling labor and economic resources into effective economic blocks. The system has basic internal units, meant to serve as internal system of communications. 

The basic idea is that business is brought to the union and it is solve from the labor pool. The system utilizes knowledge of the labor pool and its needs to determine the cost effectiveness of a given piece of business. This business is done, and the union and its members directly benefit.

This beneefit can be tied directly to the distribution of wealth into stable assets. 

So now you have a system that collects and processes information, providing a way for the community to directly benefit from its information. It provides a way to leverage the skill set of the community, to increase the wealth in the union. 

One of the basic needs for a union will be the ability to support childcare. The ability of a union to support childcare increases the workforce mobility 6x in most places. 

Creating stable locations and individuals able serve the labor needs of a community is a long term investment, of at least 4 years, but often for decades in stable communities. 

Paying for this labor is important to the community, because it provides the resources it has direct and indirect access to in the future. 

Reducing this cost is something it can do in a number of ways. - but the idea is, its a 'special interest' of a significant portion of the union, potentially. 

To handle that, this interest is expressed as a nested interest. 

In the case I am looking at - I am developing a child care union capable of purchasing and making rent free 6 homes to provide child care support for up to 36 child, and therefore, 36 parents. Our goal is to see that the business brought in makes this extra labor a net positive. 

My goal programmically, is make it so the 'cost of doing business' is made evident as part of every proposal.

This business bring the community this value for doing it. The costs to increase the labor pool are weighed directly against social support actions. Therefore the value of the 'excess' labor needs to be balanced against the cost to support them. Therefore, this forces the cost of support into the business decision of the group, and helps the group organize around communal needs and benefits: For the group to benefit, we need to do this. 

The units helps allow the union's labor pool to have a hand in the controlling these features, and maximizing their benefit within the system. Each unit, and the union, are capable of handling unlimited membership, but these systems have been scaled with an iye around 150 persons per union.

In my math that is

72 parents
6 teachers
36 * 1.5 - 2:   children and other relations

Hi - I was away IRL, and I am getting caught up. 

I have my data all engineered on my side. We just create spaces, then do the whole publish the op code sequence.

I will probably need test eth, but I'll ask when I get to that. 

I am working with the childcare provider directory that was pulled from a state datebase. This system of decentralized searching/indexing is useful for this sort of business/data. 

I have defined probably a dozen entities, with relationships and attributes, from this data. 

At this point, I just need to create spaces, and go through the process of writing the op codes to the chain. I went through a bunch of what you wrote, and the code everyone shared(thank you), and I dug around in the GRC-20. 

I have some questions about, first geo, and then future data collection. 

The role of geo is to provide a way to visually represent this data, and create a large enough catalog of structures/data to make it useful to developers? 

Since I will probably be the first developer on my data, I am confident of that, but is there anything else about uploading into Geo that I should understand?

Future data collection: This project put me down a rabbit hole, ask @tomisin3930 - Being able to 'co-process'  the jobs and the support for the jobs, is an interesting result of this tech, for me. But outside of developing apps on data placed here for this project, what steps can we start taking to start harvesting data in general?  I have a project that I've been working on that needs a system like this - where isolated datacollection points that can independently signal data collection, and independently organize data sharing to whose listening. Think isolated radio stations. 

I am excited because being able to define the 'entities' produced in this way, and structuring search in this way, makes it possible to have this be done 'cheaply', Its possible, with very low overhead, to create general points of data collection, and tie that information together contextually in a neat way.  Extremely proximate data, relative to that point.

So I am going to follow the hackathon and work to develop this initial transition.

What I want to do is have a system that allows everyone who just finished the hackathon, the technology necessary to:

1) deploy a local information network in your area,
2) the tools necessary to do that initial refinement, from multiple/many information collection points, to a single knowledge product, able to be sold in a data market
3) The technology to manage data market transactions around this data. 


---
On the hackathon front I am going to continue moving the entities into the testnet, and refining that process.

ARound that, along side that, untested, I am going to start building out all the work associated with creating these systems of knowledge.

**Childcare Knowledge Graph Import Schema**

## **Overview**

This document outlines the entity-relationship model for transforming childcare facility data into a structured **Knowledge Graph (KG)**. The schema maps out **entities**, their **attributes**, and the **relationships** between them. The goal is to enable **scalable querying, knowledge inference, and future integration with advanced graph databases (e.g., Neo4j, RDF-based systems).**

## **3. Data Import Process**

1. **Extract** raw data from CSV and preprocess it.
2. **Transform** the structured data into entity-attribute relationships.
3. **Generate Unique IDs** for all entities and relationships.
4. **Store** data in a graph-compatible database (starting with SQLite, then upgrading to Neo4j or RDF-based storage).
5. **Query** the Knowledge Graph for insights and relationships.

---

## **4. Next Steps**

6. **Test Data Import:** Run initial scripts to validate the schema.
7. **Optimize Queries:** Ensure efficient retrieval of graph relationships.
8. **Expand the Graph:** Integrate job postings, funding sources, and demand-side analytics.
9. **Migrate to Graph Database:** Deploy to a scalable infrastructure such as **Neo4j, ArangoDB, or AWS Neptune.**

### **Moving SQLite Data into Neo4j**

We will **export the structured facility data** from SQLite and **import it into Neo4j** as a **graph database**.

---

## **1️⃣ Neo4j Data Model**

In **Neo4j**, the facility data will be **structured as a graph**:

### **🔹 Nodes (Entities)**

|**Node Type**|**Label in Neo4j**|
|---|---|
|**Facility**|`:Facility`|
|**Location**|`:Location`|
|**Owner**|`:Owner`|
|**License**|`:License`|
|**School District**|`:SchoolDistrict`|

### **🔸 Relationships**

|**Relationship**|**From → To**|
|---|---|
|`:LOCATED_IN`|`(Facility) → (Location)`|
|`:OWNED_BY`|`(Facility) → (Owner)`|
|`:HAS_LICENSE`|`(Facility) → (License)`|
|`:PART_OF_DISTRICT`|`(Facility) → (SchoolDistrict)`|

---

## **2️⃣ Export Data from SQLite**

We will **export the structured SQLite data** into CSV files for **import into Neo4j**.

#### **🔹 Export Facilities**

```sql
.headers on
.mode csv
.output facilities.csv
SELECT facility_id, facility_name, phone_number, facility_type, operational_schedule, accepts_subsidies, FROM facilities;
.output stdout
```

#### **🔹 Export Locations**

```sql
.output locations.csv
SELECT location_id, city, state, zip_code FROM locations;
.output stdout
```

#### **🔹 Export Owners**

```sql
.output owners.csv
SELECT owner_id, license_number, alternative_contact_number FROM owners;
.output stdout
```

#### **🔹 Export Licenses**

```sql
.output licenses.csv
SELECT license_id, license_number, license_type, license_issue_date, license_expiry_date FROM licenses;
.output stdout
```

#### **🔹 Export School Districts**

```sql
.output school_districts.csv
SELECT district_id, district_name FROM school_districts;
.output stdout
```

#### **🔹 Export Facility Relationships**

```sql
.output facility_relationships.csv
SELECT f.facility_id, f.location_id, f.owner_id, f.license_id, f.school_district_id FROM facilities f;
.output stdout
```

## **3️⃣ Import Data into Neo4j**

**🛠 Prerequisites:**

- Install **Neo4j Desktop** or run **Neo4j Aura (Cloud)**
- **Enable CSV import** by setting:
    
    ```
    dbms.security.allow_csv_import_from_file_urls=true
    ```
    

**🛠 Place the CSV files in Neo4j's `import` directory:**

- `facilities.csv`
- `locations.csv`
- `owners.csv`
- `licenses.csv`
- `school_districts.csv`
- `facility_relationships.csv`

---

### **4️⃣ Load Nodes into Neo4j**

#### **🔹 Load Facilities**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id, name: row.facility_name, phone_number: row.phone_number, type: row.facility_type, accepts_subsidies: row.accepts_subsidies, operational_schedule:row.operational_schedule});
```

#### **🔹 Load Locations**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///locations.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Location {location_id: row.location_id, city: row.city, state: row.state, zip_code: row.zip_code});
```

#### **🔹 Load Owners**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///owners.csv' AS row
CREATE (:Owner {owner_id: row.owner_id, license_number: row.license_number, alternative_contact: row.alternative_contact_number});
```

#### **🔹 Load Licenses**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///licenses.csv' AS row
CREATE (:License {license_id: row.license_id, license_number: row.license_number, type: row.license_type, issue_date: row.license_issue_date, expiry_date: row.license_expiry_date});
```

#### **🔹 Load School Districts**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///school_districts.csv' AS row
CREATE (:SchoolDistrict {district_id: row.district_id, name: row.district_name});
```

---

### **5️⃣ Load Relationships into Neo4j**

#### **🔹 Link Facilities to Locations**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (l:Location {location_id: row.location_id})
MERGE (f)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l);
```

#### **🔹 Link Facilities to Owners**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (o:Owner {owner_id: row.owner_id})
MERGE (f)-[:OWNED_BY]->(o);
```

#### **🔹 Link Facilities to Licenses**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (lic:License {license_id: row.license_id})
MERGE (f)-[:HAS_LICENSE]->(lic);
```

#### **🔹 Link Facilities to School Districts**

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facility_relationships.csv' AS row
MATCH (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
MATCH (sd:SchoolDistrict {district_id: row.school_district_id})
MERGE (f)-[:PART_OF_DISTRICT]->(sd);
```

---

## **6️⃣ Verify Data in Neo4j**

### **Check Facilities**

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility) RETURN f LIMIT 10;
```

### **Check a Facility’s Relationships**

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility)-[r]->(e) RETURN f, r, e LIMIT 10;
```

---

## **7️⃣ Querying the Data in Neo4j**

### **Find Facilities in a Specific City**

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(l:Location {city: "New York"})
RETURN f.name, l.city;
```

### **Find Who Owns a Specific Facility**

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility)-[:OWNED_BY]->(o:Owner)
WHERE f.name = "Sunshine Daycare"
RETURN f.name, o.license_number;
```

### **Find All Facilities Under a School District**

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility)-[:PART_OF_DISTRICT]->(sd:SchoolDistrict)
WHERE sd.name = "Chicago Public Schools"
RETURN f.name, sd.name;
```

Got it. We'll start with a simple database setup, then scale up as needed. Here's the plan:

### **Step 1: Set Up a Local Development Environment**

We'll create a **Python-based environment** that:

1. Loads the CSV file into a **lightweight database** (e.g., SQLite).
2. Provides basic querying capabilities.
3. Sets up a structure that allows easy migration to a more powerful database later.

### **Step 2: Load Data into SQLite**

- SQLite is a **file-based database** that requires no setup.
- We’ll define a **schema** based on your CSV structure.
- Import the data **efficiently** and ensure basic indexing for queries.

### **Step 3: Provide Query Access**

- Expose basic query functions in Python.
- Implement basic search/filter operations.

### **Step 4: Make It Scalable**

- Ensure the database structure can be **easily migrated** to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a graph database.

### **Implementation**

I’ll set up the Python script now. Upload the CSV file, and I’ll process it into SQLite. Then, we can explore the data and refine the schema before moving to a more advanced system.

### **Plan: Transform CSV Data into a Knowledge Graph**

We'll break down the **childcare facility database** into a **graph-based structure** by extracting:

1. **Entities** (Nodes) â€“ e.g., Facilities, Locations, Owners, Certifications, Services
2. **Attributes** (Properties of Entities) â€“ e.g., Facility Name, Address, Capacity
3. **Relationships** (Edges) â€“ e.g., `FACILITY_HAS_OWNER`, `FACILITY_LOCATED_IN`, `FACILITY_OFFER_SERVICE`

---

### **Step 1: Extend the Database Schema for a Graph Representation**

To store this in a database:

- SQLite is **not ideal** for graphs.
- We can start by **storing graph-like data in SQLite** using **three tables**:
    - `entities`: Stores unique entities (facilities, locations, etc.)
    - `attributes`: Stores entity properties as key-value pairs
    - `relationships`: Stores edges (how entities relate)

### **Step 2: Implement SQL Schema for Graph Storage**

Modify `import_data.py`:

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
import hashlib

# Load CSV
csv_file = "childcare_data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)

# Connect to SQLite
conn = sqlite3.connect("childcare_graph.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Drop old tables (if reloading data)
cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS entities")
cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS attributes")
cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS relationships")

# Create new schema
cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE entities (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type TEXT,
    name TEXT
)
""")

cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE attributes (
    entity_id TEXT,
    key TEXT,
    value TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (entity_id) REFERENCES entities (id)
)
""")

cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE relationships (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    from_entity TEXT,
    to_entity TEXT,
    relationship_type TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (from_entity) REFERENCES entities (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (to_entity) REFERENCES entities (id)
)
""")

# Function to generate unique IDs
def generate_id(value):
    return hashlib.md5(value.encode()).hexdigest()

# Insert data as entities and attributes
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    facility_id = generate_id(row["Facility Name"])  # Unique ID for facility
    location_id = generate_id(row["Address"])  # Unique ID for location

    # Insert Facility entity
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO entities (id, entity_type, name) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", 
                   (facility_id, "Facility", row["Facility Name"]))

    # Insert Location entity
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO entities (id, entity_type, name) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", 
                   (location_id, "Location", row["Address"]))

    # Add attributes for Facility
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO attributes (entity_id, key, value) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                   (facility_id, "Capacity", str(row["Capacity"])))
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO attributes (entity_id, key, value) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                   (facility_id, "License Number", row["License Number"]))

    # Insert Relationship (Facility Located In Address)
    rel_id = generate_id(f"{facility_id}_LOCATED_IN_{location_id}")
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO relationships (id, from_entity, to_entity, relationship_type) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
                   (rel_id, facility_id, location_id, "LOCATED_IN"))

# Commit and close
conn.commit()
conn.close()

print("Data imported into graph-like SQLite structure.")
```

---

### **Step 3: Query the Knowledge Graph**

You can now **run SQL queries** to extract **entities, relationships, and attributes**.

#### **Find a Facility by Name**

```sql
SELECT * FROM entities WHERE entity_type='Facility' AND name='Bright Kids Daycare';
```

#### **Find Attributes of a Facility**

```sql
SELECT key, value FROM attributes WHERE entity_id = (SELECT id FROM entities WHERE name='Bright Kids Daycare');
```

#### **Find a Facility's Location**

```sql
SELECT e.name FROM entities e 
JOIN relationships r ON e.id = r.to_entity 
WHERE r.from_entity = (SELECT id FROM entities WHERE name='Bright Kids Daycare') 
AND r.relationship_type='LOCATED_IN';
```

---

### **Step 4: Future Migration to Neo4j or Graph Databases**

While SQLite helps us **prototype** a graph, **graph databases** like **Neo4j, ArangoDB, or AWS Neptune** will be better long term.

We can **export this SQLite structure** into Neo4j or any RDF-compatible format.

#### **Next Steps**

4. **Refine Graph Schema** â€“ Define more entity types (Owners, Certifications, Reviews, etc.).
5. **Add More Relationships** â€“ Link childcare facilities to government data, job postings, etc.
6. **Migrate to Neo4j or RDF** â€“ Use a dedicated **graph DB** for scalable querying.

Let me know if you want to go deeper into **RDF triples** or **Neo4j setup**! ðŸš€

### **Workflow for Creating Entities and Importing Data into SQLite**

Now that we have our **childcare data** in SQLite, the goal is to transform it into the **knowledge graph format** by extracting **entities, attributes, and relationships** in a structured process.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ High-Level Workflow**

We will follow this step-by-step process:

1. **Extract Raw Data** from the existing SQLite table(s).
2. **Normalize Data into Entities** ‚Äì Convert records into structured entities like Facilities, Locations, Owners, etc.
3. **Generate Unique Identifiers** ‚Äì Create unique IDs (e.g., hash-based) for each entity.
4. **Store Entities in Separate Tables** ‚Äì Insert each entity into its respective table.
5. **Extract and Store Relationships** ‚Äì Create a mapping of how entities connect.
6. **Ensure Data Integrity & Indexing** ‚Äì Optimize the structure for fast queries.
7. **Migrate to a Graph Database** (future step).

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Database Schema (Tables in SQLite)**

We will create the following tables in SQLite to store our Knowledge Graph data:

### **Entities Table Structure**

|Table Name|Entity Type|Primary Key|Attributes (Examples)|
|---|---|---|---|
|`entities`|Stores all entities|`id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`entity_type, name`|
|`facilities`|Childcare facilities|`facility_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`facility_name, license_number, capacity`|
|`locations`|Facility locations|`location_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`address, city, state, zip_code, county`|
|`owners`|Facility owners/operators|`owner_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`name, contact_info, org_type`|
|`services`|Childcare services|`service_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`service_name, age_group, cost_structure`|
|`staff`|Childcare providers|`staff_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`name, role, certifications`|
|`reviews`|Ratings & feedback|`review_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`rating, reviewer_type, review_text`|
|`certifications`|Accreditations|`certification_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`cert_name, issuing_body, expiration_date`|
|`inspections`|Regulatory checks|`inspection_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`date, outcome, violations`|

### **Relationships Table Structure**

|Table Name|Relationship|Primary Key|From Entity|To Entity|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`relationships`|Generic relationship storage|`id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)`|`from_entity_id`|`to_entity_id`|
|`facility_location`|`FACILITY_LOCATED_IN`|`facility_id + location_id`|`facility_id`|`location_id`|
|`facility_owner`|`FACILITY_OWNED_BY`|`facility_id + owner_id`|`facility_id`|`owner_id`|
|`facility_service`|`FACILITY_PROVIDES`|`facility_id + service_id`|`facility_id`|`service_id`|
|`facility_staff`|`FACILITY_HAS_STAFF`|`facility_id + staff_id`|`facility_id`|`staff_id`|
|`facility_review`|`FACILITY_HAS_REVIEW`|`facility_id + review_id`|`facility_id`|`review_id`|
|`facility_certification`|`FACILITY_HAS_CERTIFICATION`|`facility_id + certification_id`|`facility_id`|`certification_id`|
|`facility_inspection`|`FACILITY_INSPECTED_BY`|`facility_id + inspection_id`|`facility_id`|`inspection_id`|

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow to Import Data into Knowledge Graph Tables**

### **Step 1: Extract Data from the Existing SQLite Table**

Modify `import_data.py` to fetch raw records from the initial table:

```python
import sqlite3
import hashlib

# Connect to SQLite
conn = sqlite3.connect("childcare.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Fetch raw facility data
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM childcare_facilities")
facilities = cursor.fetchall()

# for facility in facilities:
  #  print(facility)

conn.close()
```

---

### **Step 2: Generate Unique Identifiers**

Each entity needs a **unique ID** to avoid duplicates.

```python
def generate_id(value):
    """Create a unique ID using MD5 hash"""
    return hashlib.md5(value.encode()).hexdigest()
```

---

### **Step 3: Insert Entities into Respective Tables**

Insert **Facilities**:

```python
for facility in facilities:
    facility_id = generate_id(facility[0])  # Facility Name as unique identifier
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO facilities (facility_id, facility_name, license_number, capacity) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
                   (facility_id, facility[0], facility[1], facility[2]))
```

Insert **Locations**:

```python
for facility in facilities:
    location_id = generate_id(facility[3])  # Address as unique identifier
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO locations (location_id, address, city, state, zip_code) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
                   (location_id, facility[3], facility[4], facility[5], facility[6]))
```

Insert **Owners**:

```python
for facility in facilities:
    owner_id = generate_id(facility[7])  # Owner Name as unique identifier
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO owners (owner_id, name, contact_info, org_type) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
                   (owner_id, facility[7], facility[8], facility[9]))
```

---

### **Step 4: Insert Relationships into the Graph Structure**

Link **Facilities to Locations**:

```python
for facility in facilities:
    facility_id = generate_id(facility[0])
    location_id = generate_id(facility[3])

    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO facility_location (facility_id, location_id) VALUES (?, ?)", 
                   (facility_id, location_id))
```

Link **Facilities to Owners**:

```python
for facility in facilities:
    facility_id = generate_id(facility[0])
    owner_id = generate_id(facility[7])

    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO facility_owner (facility_id, owner_id) VALUES (?, ?)", 
                   (facility_id, owner_id))
```

---

### **Step 5: Commit Changes and Close Database**

```python
conn.commit()
conn.close()
print("Entities and relationships imported successfully!")
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Automating the Workflow**

To streamline the import, we can create a Python script (`run_import.sh`) to:

8. **Run Data Extraction**
9. **Transform Entities**
10. **Insert Data into the Knowledge Graph**
11. **Validate Imports**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting Childcare KG Import Process..."
python import_data.py
echo "Data Import Completed Successfully!"
```

Run the script:

```bash
chmod +x run_import.sh
./run_import.sh
```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps**

12. **Test Queries**: Validate entity-relationship queries in SQLite.
13. **Optimize Data Extraction**: Pre-process CSV data for missing values and inconsistencies.
14. **Improve Relationship Handling**: Extend relationships to **Services, Reviews, Inspections, and Certifications**.
15. **Migrate to a Graph Database**: Move data to **Neo4j or RDF-based storage** for advanced querying.

### **Outcome**

This workflow ensures **structured entity extraction, proper indexing, and relationship mapping**, making the system **scalable and ready for graph-based querying.** üöÄ

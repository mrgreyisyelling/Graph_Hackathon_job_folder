It looks like there's a **syntax issue** in your SQLite command. The correct way to export **locations** from SQLite to CSV is:

### **âœ… Correct Command**

```bash
sqlite3 childcare.db -csv -header "SELECT location_id, city, state, zip_code FROM locations;" > locations.csv
```

---

## **ðŸš€ Fixes Applied**

1. **Fixed missing space after `FROM locations`**:
    
    - **Incorrect:** `FROM locationslocation_id`
    - **Correct:** `FROM locations`
2. **Ensured proper SQL syntax**:
    
    - The original had incorrect column selection.
3. **Exporting locations data correctly** to `locations.csv`.

## **ðŸ’¡ Exporting Other Tables**

Run these commands for other entities:

### **Facilities**

```bash

   
    operational_schedule TEXT,
sqlite3 childcare.db -csv -header "SELECT facility_id, facility_name, phone_number, facility_type, accepts_subsidies FROM facilities;" > facilities.csv
```

### **Owners**

```bash
sqlite3 childcare.db -csv -header "SELECT owner_id, license_number, alternative_contact_number FROM owners;" > owners.csv
```

### **Licenses**

```bash
sqlite3 childcare.db -csv -header "SELECT license_id, license_number, license_type, license_issue_date, license_expiry_date FROM licenses;" > licenses.csv
```

### **School Districts**

```bash
sqlite3 childcare.db -csv -header "SELECT district_id, district_name FROM school_districts;" > school_districts.csv
```

## **ðŸ›  Verify CSV Files**

After running these commands, **check if the CSV files were created**:

```bash
ls -lah
```

or check contents with:

```bash
cat locations.csv | head -n 5
```

---

## **Next Step: Move CSV Files to Neo4j `import` Folder**

If you're importing into **Neo4j**, move the files:

```bash
mv locations.csv /var/lib/neo4j/import/
mv facilities.csv /var/lib/neo4j/import/
mv owners.csv /var/lib/neo4j/import/
mv licenses.csv /var/lib/neo4j/import/
mv school_districts.csv /var/lib/neo4j/import/
```

Now, you can **run the Cypher import queries** in Neo4j! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

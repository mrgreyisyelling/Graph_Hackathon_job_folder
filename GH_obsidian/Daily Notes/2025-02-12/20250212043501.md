### **🚀 Defining a Cluster in Neo4j as Part of Data Insertion**

If you want to **define clusters explicitly during data insertion**, you need a way to **group entities logically** so that Neo4j can treat them as part of a "cluster."

### **✅ Ways to Define a Cluster While Inserting Data**

1. **Using a `Cluster` Label on Nodes**
2. **Adding a `cluster_id` Property**
3. **Explicitly Creating a `Cluster` Node and Connecting Entities**
4. **Using a `COMMUNITY` Relationship to Link Entities**

---

## **1️⃣ Assigning a `Cluster` Label to Nodes**

One simple way to cluster data is by adding a **`Cluster` label** while inserting the nodes.

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
MERGE (f:Facility:Cluster {facility_id: row.facility_id}) 
SET f.name = row.facility_name, 
    f.type = row.facility_type;
```

✅ **What This Does:**

- Facilities will **automatically be part of a "Cluster"** because they share the `Cluster` label.

---

## **2️⃣ Adding a `cluster_id` Property**

Another approach is to **assign a cluster ID** to each node.

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
MERGE (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
SET f.name = row.facility_name,
    f.type = row.facility_type,
    f.cluster_id = row.zip_code;  // Example: Clustering by Zip Code
```

✅ **What This Does:**

- Facilities with the same `zip_code` will have the same `cluster_id`, forming an **implicit cluster**.

---

## **3️⃣ Explicitly Creating a `Cluster` Node**

If you want a separate `Cluster` entity that groups facilities, you can **create a `Cluster` node**.

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
MERGE (c:Cluster {cluster_id: row.zip_code})  // Define a cluster by Zip Code
SET c.name = "Cluster " + row.zip_code

MERGE (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
SET f.name = row.facility_name,
    f.type = row.facility_type

MERGE (f)-[:PART_OF]->(c);  // Link Facility to its Cluster
```

✅ **What This Does:**

- Groups Facilities **under a `Cluster` node** based on Zip Code.
- Queries can find **all facilities in the same cluster**.

---

## **4️⃣ Using a `COMMUNITY` Relationship to Link Entities**

If you don't want a separate `Cluster` node but still want to define relationships, you can **connect related entities directly**.

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///facilities.csv' AS row
MERGE (f:Facility {facility_id: row.facility_id})
SET f.name = row.facility_name,
    f.type = row.facility_type

// Find other facilities in the same Zip Code and link them
MATCH (other:Facility {zip_code: row.zip_code})
WHERE other.facility_id <> f.facility_id
MERGE (f)-[:COMMUNITY]->(other);
```

✅ **What This Does:**

- Facilities in the **same zip code** are linked **via `COMMUNITY` relationships**.
- This creates **an implicit cluster structure**.

---

## **🔍 Query to See Clusters**

After inserting data, you can **retrieve clusters**.

### **✅ Find All Facilities in a Cluster**

```cypher
MATCH (c:Cluster)-[:PART_OF]-(f:Facility)
RETURN c.cluster_id, collect(f.name);
```

✅ **Returns:**

- The cluster **ID**
- A **list of facilities** in that cluster

---

### **✅ Find All Connected Facilities in a Community**

```cypher
MATCH (f:Facility)-[:COMMUNITY]->(other:Facility)
RETURN f.name, collect(other.name) LIMIT 10;
```

✅ **Returns:**

- A **Facility**
- Other **Facilities in the same cluster**

---

## **🚀 Next Steps**

1. **Which clustering method do you want to use?**
    - **Separate `Cluster` node** (best for explicit groupings).
    - **Community relationships** (best for linking similar entities).
    - **Cluster ID on each node** (best for lightweight filtering).
2. **Would you like a cleanup query before running this?**

### **Systematically Assigning Childcare Jobs to Maximize Workers**

To **maximize labor participation**, we will:

1. **Identify all workers who require childcare.**
2. **Determine how many childcare jobs are needed.**
3. **Assign childcare jobs to workers who**:
    - **Cannot do the primary jobs** due to lack of required skills.
    - **Are otherwise unemployed or underutilized.**
4. **Prioritize maximizing overall workforce participation.**

### **üöÄ Running the Childcare Job Assignment System**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Start the API for generating childcare jobs**

```sh
python backend/api/generate_childcare_jobs.py
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Visit the frontend**

```
http://127.0.0.1:5500/forms/generate_childcare_jobs.html
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Click "Generate Jobs" to create childcare jobs and assign workers.**

---

### **üîç Expected Output**

#### **Childcare Job Generation**

```
Total Jobs Created: 3
```

#### **Childcare Worker Assignments**

|**Childcare Job ID**|**Assigned Worker ID**|**Worker Name**|
|---|---|---|
|101|7|John Doe|
|102|12|Sarah Smith|
|103|19|Robert Lee|

**Interpretation:**

- **Job 1 had 10 workers needing childcare ‚Üí 2 childcare jobs created.**
- **Job 2 had 4 workers needing childcare ‚Üí 1 childcare job created.**
- **Workers who cannot work in the primary job were selected for childcare jobs.**

---

### **üöÄ Now the system:**

‚úÖ **Identifies childcare needs.**  
‚úÖ **Determines how many childcare jobs are required.**  
‚úÖ **Prioritizes assigning childcare jobs to workers who cannot do the primary job.**  
‚úÖ **Maximizes overall workforce participation.**

**Try this and let me know if this achieves your goal! üöÄüî•**

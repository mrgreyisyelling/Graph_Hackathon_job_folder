### **Adjusting Social Unit Impact Calculation**

We will modify the calculation so that **one unit of childcare frees up to 6 workers, and one unit of transportation frees up to 4 workers.**

This means that instead of unlocking **only 1 worker per unit of labor**, each social unit type will have **different efficiency rates**.

```

### **üöÄ Steps to Run the Updated Simulation**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Restart the API**

```sh
python backend/api/filter_workers.py
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Visit the Frontend**

```
http://127.0.0.1:5500/forms/social_unit_impact.html
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Click the button to calculate impact.**

---

### **üîç Expected Output**

|**Need**|**Workers Unlocked**|**Remaining Workers**|**Freed Workers**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Childcare|6|3|Alice, Bob, Eve, Joe, Mike, Sarah|
|Transportation|4|2|David, Chris, Laura, Steve|
|Remote Work|3|1|Mark, Tom, Jane|

**Interpretation:**

- Childcare had **9 workers in need**, so **1 unit freed 6**.
- Transportation had **6 workers in need**, so **1 unit freed 4**.
- Remote Work had **4 workers in need**, so **1 unit freed 3**.

---

### **üöÄ Next Steps**

1. **Allow users to input multiple labor units for testing scalability.**
2. **Incorporate real-world thresholds for labor needs.**
3. **Ensure freed workers move into the "Available for Work" category automatically.**

This should now accurately model how **social unit intervention unlocks more labor capacity.** Let me know if you need further adjustments! üöÄüî•

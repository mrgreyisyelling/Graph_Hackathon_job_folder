ðŸŽ‰ **Awesome! The plugin is finally loading!** ðŸŽ‰

Now, let's **test** if it's correctly extracting triples and logging data.

---

### **âœ… Step 1: Test Triple Extraction**

1. **Create a new Markdown note in Obsidian** and add this YAML frontmatter:
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    entity: "Hell Gate"
    attributes:
      - "Connected to: [[Basement]]"
      - "Danger Level: High"
    ---
    ```
    
2. **Rename the file** (this triggers the `rename` event in the plugin).
3. **Check the Obsidian Console**:
    - Press **`Ctrl + Shift + I`** (**Cmd + Option + I** on Mac).
    - Click the **Console** tab.
    - Look for a log message like:
        
        ```
        Extracted Triples: [{ entity: 'Hell Gate', attribute: 'Connected to', value: 'Basement' }, ...]
        ```

### **âœ… Step 2: Verify the Knowledge Graph View**

If the plugin includes a **view component (`TripleView`)**, open it:

4. Click **More Options (â‹®) â†’ Open Triple Knowledge Graph**.
5. **Check if the extracted triples are displayed.**

---

### **âœ… Step 3: Debug if Needed**

If **triples donâ€™t appear**:

- **Manually modify the note** and save it.
- **Check the console for errors**.
- If something **isn't working**, paste the **latest error message**, and I'll debug it.

### **ðŸš€ Next Steps**

Now that the plugin is running, do you want to:

6. **Export triples to a database** (SQLite, JSON, or RDF)?
7. **Create a UI to manually edit triples?**
8. **Improve the knowledge graph visualization?**

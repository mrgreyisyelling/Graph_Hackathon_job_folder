    We have to deal with three KG:
    
    - the one represented abstractly on Chain
    - The one utilized 'locally' for querying
    - the one utilized locally - for the individual to add to or modify

    Moving data upward is straight forward, - It just has to get to the API to process the data to triples. But where that information can be as simple as 'a form' on 'a single web page' - fixed entry. We can use something like Obsidian that has an internal linking structure that could be co-oped. Plugins for obsidian work on both phones and computers. It allows for a 'personal offline' representation of the 'global' KG. It allows forthe 'mixing' of global KG locally Meanwhile, the plug in can with two levels of hard :submit to the cloud server to be packed or submit 'edits' directly to the global. I believe it will be more normal for KG to be locally mixed before being refined further. There will need to be a person who, at the group level, pays for the expansion of knowledge systems. So the union organizes the development of the KG into something that is continually useful and up-to-date. Like a librarian. So Changes to the local graph are maintained - in two states, centralized and decentralized. Centralized relies on the 'live' copy. Decentralized is the current 'written' version. So an individual, can arrange their knowledge in this manner, and relate themselves to different states of knowledge. The decentralized one has greater costs associated with it, so only select things are moved there, but it exists in a way that allows all members to develop off of the known state. The live state is merged, and manicured, from these known states. What information is moved to the global state depends on the work of the middleman, or establishing a permanent contract that will take any API submissions from qualified members. Who is qualified? sociology question, locally defined.

    boot strap it - Create a network of local obsidians that use github or publish to communicate their content or structure. The local station reads this and combines the individual KG into a combined KG, that is publically viewable, downloadable. From this 'community garden' individual items are clipped an put into the global Triples

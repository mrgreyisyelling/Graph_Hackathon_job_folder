Got it. You need to focus on **representing triples in Obsidian** and then leveraging the **plugin system to sync and structure the Knowledge Graph (KG).**

### **Step 1: Structuring Triples in Obsidian**

In Obsidian, you need a format that allows:

- **Entities** (Nodes)
- **Relationships** (Edges)
- **Attributes** (Properties)

Obsidian's **internal link structure** (e.g., `[[entity]]`) naturally supports relationships, but it needs additional structure for **triples**.

#### **Possible Triple Representation in Obsidian:**

1. **YAML Frontmatter Approach** (for metadata and structured parsing)
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    entity: "Hell Gate"
    type: "Location"
    attributes:
      - "Danger Level: High"
      - "Connected to: [[Basement]]"
      - "Story Element: Entrance to the underworld"
    ---
    ```
    
    - This structure makes it easier to extract and process.
    - Works well with **dataview** and custom plugins.
2. **Inline Triple Representation**
    
    ```
    - **Entity**: Hell Gate
    - **Attribute**: Danger Level
    - **Value**: High
    - **Relationship**: Connected to → [[Basement]]
    ```
    
    - This is human-readable but harder to extract programmatically.
3. **Custom Block for Explicit Triples**
    
    ```
    TRIPLE:: Hell Gate | Connected to | Basement
    TRIPLE:: Hell Gate | Story Element | Entrance to the underworld
    ```
    
    - Custom parsers in the plugin can scan for `TRIPLE::` blocks and extract relationships.

### **Step 2: Using the Obsidian Plugin System**

Once the data is structured in a predictable format, the plugin needs to:

4. **Extract Triples**: Parse notes for entities, attributes, and relationships.
5. **Sync to a Local KG**: Store structured triples in an internal database.
6. **Sync to a Global KG**: Push selective entries to a community or blockchain-based knowledge graph.

### **Plugin Features You Need**

✅ **Parsing Engine** – Reads notes and extracts triples.  
✅ **Graph View Integration** – Uses Obsidian’s graph to represent relationships.  
✅ **Syncing System** – Determines when and how local changes sync to the broader KG.  
✅ **Submission Layer** – Defines what goes on-chain and what remains local.

### **Step 3: Build the First Plugin Version**

- Start with **parsing triples from notes** and rendering them in a structured table.
- Then **connect the plugin to a local database** (IndexedDB or JSON store).
- Later, integrate **syncing to GitHub or an API**.

### **Immediate Next Steps**

7. **Choose the Triple Format** (YAML, Inline, or Custom Blocks).
8. **Write a simple script/plugin** to extract and display triples in Obsidian.
9. **Test the parsing on a few structured notes** before moving to sync logic.

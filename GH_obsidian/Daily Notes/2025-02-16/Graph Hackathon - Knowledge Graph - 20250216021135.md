Yes, based on your uploaded files, everything appears to be structured **according to the plan**.

### **🚀 Summary of What We Have Done:**

1️⃣ **Created a `Triple` type** (`types.ts`) to ensure consistent data handling.  
2️⃣ **Updated `merge.ts` to merge KGs while preserving `master_version` and `live_version`.**  
3️⃣ **Ensured `parser.ts` correctly extracts triples and applies the versioning structure.**  
4️⃣ **Integrated the merge command inside `main.ts` to run within Obsidian.**

### **✅ Next Steps: Testing & Debugging**

Run the following to **build and test the plugin:**

```sh
npm run build
cp dist/main.js ./
```

Then, restart **Obsidian** and:  
🔹 **Run `"Merge External Knowledge Graph"` in the Command Palette.**  
🔹 **Check `triples.json` to see if merging works as expected.**  
🔹 **Verify that `master_version` and `live_version` are handled properly.**

### **🚀 What’s Next?**

1️⃣ **Do you want to track changes in a log file (`merge_log.json`)?**  
2️⃣ **Would you like a UI inside Obsidian to preview `"Master"` vs `"Live"` before merging?**  
3️⃣ **Should we move towards visualizing the KG in a graph format?**

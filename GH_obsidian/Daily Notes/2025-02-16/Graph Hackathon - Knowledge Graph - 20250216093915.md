Let's start building the **Obsidian plugin** to extract triples from YAML metadata and structure them into a **local Knowledge Graph (KG)**. I'll create the initial structure and functionality.

---

### **Plugin Features (MVP)**

1. **Extract YAML metadata** from notes.
2. **Parse entities, attributes, and relationships** into triples.
3. **Store triples in a local database (IndexedDB or JSON file).**
4. **Render structured triples inside Obsidian (table view).**
5. **Enable basic querying to navigate relationships.**

### **Plugin Structure**

- **`main.ts`** â†’ Entry point for the Obsidian plugin.
- **`parser.ts`** â†’ Extracts triples from YAML metadata.
- **`store.ts`** â†’ Handles local storage of the KG.
- **`view.ts`** â†’ Renders a table view of triples in Obsidian.
- **`settings.ts`** â†’ Configuration options for future expansion.

### **Initial Implementation**

I'll draft the basic `main.ts` to load the plugin and process triples from YAML.

This is the **core plugin structure** that:

6. **Loads the plugin** and initializes the local knowledge graph store.
7. **Monitors file modifications** in Obsidian and extracts triples from YAML.
8. **Processes all markdown files** in the vault on startup.
9. **Provides a settings tab** for potential configurations.

Next Steps:

- Implement `parser.ts` to extract YAML-based triples.
- Create `store.ts` to manage triples locally.
- Develop `view.ts` to render the structured triples.

Let me know which piece you want to tackle next! ðŸš€

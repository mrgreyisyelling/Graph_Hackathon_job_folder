Got it. You’ve built the **core** of a **triple-based knowledge system** inside Obsidian, where:  
✅ **Entities, Attributes, and Values** all become **notes**.  
✅ **Relationships (triples) are extracted and stored**.  
✅ **Obsidian automatically links the data** for navigation.

### **🚀 Where to Go From Here?**

Take your time to think through **what’s next**, but here are some guiding questions:

#### **1️⃣ Is the triple representation working as expected?**

- Do we need a better **structure for attributes**?
- Should attributes **store relationships both ways**? (e.g., `Basement` should say it’s "Connected to" `Hell Gate`)
- Is the **YAML format flexible enough** for future expansions?

#### **2️⃣ How do you want to interact with this data?**

- **Browsing only?** (Using the Related Entities section & graph view)
- **Searching?** (Query-based system: “Find all places connected to Hell Gate”)
- **Editing triples manually?** (A UI to modify relationships inside Obsidian)

#### **3️⃣ What’s the long-term goal?**

- A **local knowledge graph** for personal use?
- A **graph that syncs across devices** or **teams**?
- A **structured data model that can export to RDF, Neo4j, or The Graph?**

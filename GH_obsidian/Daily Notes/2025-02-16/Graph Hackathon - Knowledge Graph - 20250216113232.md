🎉 **Success! The plugin is correctly extracting triples!** 🎉

Now that we have the extracted triples, let's discuss **what's next**. Here are some possible next steps:

---

### **🚀 Next Steps: Where Do You Want to Go?**

1️⃣ **📄 Store the Extracted Triples**

- Save the extracted triples into a **JSON file** in the vault.
- Store them in **Obsidian's DataStore (local storage)**.
- Export to an **SQLite database** for structured querying.

2️⃣ **📊 Visualize the Knowledge Graph**

- Create a **graph view** inside the plugin (using D3.js or Cytoscape.js).
- Show **node connections** (`entity → attribute → value`).
- Use **Obsidian's built-in graph view** to visualize entity relationships.

3️⃣ **📡 Sync to an External System**

- Connect the extracted triples to **The Graph / Subgraph** for decentralized indexing.
- Allow other users to **query the knowledge graph remotely**.
- Export data in **RDF / SPARQL format** for advanced knowledge graph analysis.

4️⃣ **🖊️ UI for Editing the Triples**

- Let users **manually edit triples** in Obsidian.
- Create a **side panel UI** to modify or delete entries.
- Add a way to **link extracted triples to other notes**.

- **Do you want to store triples first?** (JSON, SQLite, or something else?)
- **Do you want to start working on visualization?**
- **Do you want to sync this data to a bigger knowledge system?**

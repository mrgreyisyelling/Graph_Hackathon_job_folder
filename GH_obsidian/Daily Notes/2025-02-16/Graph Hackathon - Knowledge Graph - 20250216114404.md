### **🚀 Summary: What We Just Built**

1. **Fixed Plugin Loading Issues**
    
    - Debugged missing dependencies (`js-yaml`, `webpack`).
    - Ensured all compiled `.js` files (`main.js`, `parser.js`, `store.js`, `view.js`) were present.
2. **Extracted Triples from YAML Frontmatter**
    
    - When a Markdown note with YAML is renamed, the plugin:  
        ✅ **Parses YAML** using `js-yaml`.  
        ✅ **Extracts triples** (Entity → Attribute → Value).  
        ✅ **Stores triples** in `KnowledgeGraphStore`.
3. **Saved Extracted Triples to `triples.json`**
    
    - ✅ **Writes extracted triples to a local JSON file inside the Obsidian vault**.
    - ✅ **Allows reviewing outputs over multiple tests**.

### **📌 Next Steps: Where We Need to Go**

Now that triples are **being extracted and stored**, we need to decide **what's next**.

#### **1️⃣ Improve Data Storage & Management**

🔹 **Current Issue:** Right now, every rename **overwrites `triples.json`**.  
✅ **Possible Fixes:**

- **Append new triples** instead of overwriting.
- **Store triples per note** (`triples/<filename>.json`).
- **Use a small database** (SQLite, IndexedDB, or Obsidian's internal storage).

---

#### **2️⃣ Build a Knowledge Graph UI**

🔹 **Current Issue:** Data is only logged, but **there's no way to see relationships**.  
✅ **Possible Fixes:**

- **Create a Triple Viewer in Obsidian** (show triples in a sidebar panel).
- **Graph Visualization**: Use **D3.js** or **Obsidian’s Graph View**.
- **Let users search for entities/relationships** in the UI.

---

#### **3️⃣ Extend the Graph Beyond Obsidian**

🔹 **Current Issue:** Right now, triples exist **only in Obsidian**.  
✅ **Possible Fixes:**

- **Export triples as RDF/SPARQL for knowledge graph tools**.
- **Sync with The Graph/Subgraphs** (Web3 knowledge integration).
- **Allow multiple users to contribute triples** via a shared system.

### **📌 What’s Next?**

Where do you want to go from here?

4. **Better storage** (append, per-note files, database)?
5. **A UI to view & search triples in Obsidian?**
6. **Graph visualization?**
7. **Integration with external knowledge systems?**

Yes, I understand what we’re dealing with here.

### **Core Concepts:**

1. **Obsidian as the Interface for Knowledge Graphs (KGs)**
    
    - Each participant (parents, teachers, children) contributes structured knowledge in **Obsidian**, where notes represent entities and links represent relationships.
    - These local KGs are synthesized into a **larger, queryable KG** that fuels the game.
2. **Three-Tier KG System**
    
    - **On-Chain KG** (abstract representation of knowledge)
    - **Local KG** (for querying and evolving game structures)
    - **Personal KG** (where individual players/teachers contribute and modify content)
3. **The ‘Hell’ Game for 0-4 Year Olds**
    
    - The game simulates a daycare dungeon where kids interact with a mythological "hell."
    - Parents and teachers curate "scary material" and structure **dungeons and traps**.
    - The teacher progresses the narrative, engaging kids in interactive storytelling.
4. **Gameplay Loop**
    
    - **Parents and teachers** build out the lore and structure of "hell."
    - **Kids explore** the dungeon through teacher-led experiences.
    - **Success metrics** (child well-being, engagement) are tracked via systems like ASQ.
    - **Data flows upward**, refining the local KG before committing select knowledge on-chain.
    - A **MUD-like on-chain system** tracks game progression, integrating player interactions.
5. **Integration with Blockchain and Automation**
    
    - MUD-like adventure system recorded on-chain.
    - KG data feeds into **a public ‘community garden’ of knowledge**, with selective entries committed on-chain.
    - GitHub (or similar) could be used to bootstrap and sync Obsidian knowledge graphs across participants.

### **Next Steps for Implementation:**

- **Design an Obsidian Plugin** to structure and format local KGs.
- **Build a system** to merge local KGs into a community KG.
- **Develop the MUD framework** to represent game mechanics using the KG.
- **Create parent/teacher workflows** for contributing to the evolving narrative.

### **Key Questions to Solve:**

- How do we **standardize** KG entries for structured storytelling?
- How does the **local KG system merge** into a global KG?
- What **game mechanics** emerge from the KG's dynamic nature?
- How do **children’s interactions** alter the KG/game world in real-time?
- What **visual elements** aid engagement for non-reading kids?

### **Your Path Forward**

- If this is a hackathon project, you need a **minimum viable prototype** for merging KGs and displaying their contents in a game format.
- Your **Obsidian plugin & local KG integration** are foundational steps.
- You need a **clear, simple path** for parents & teachers to contribute data.

**Let’s clarify—what’s the immediate piece you want to build first?**

- **Obsidian plugin for structured KG input?**
- **A way to merge local KGs into a community graph?**
- **Basic MUD mechanics using KG data?**

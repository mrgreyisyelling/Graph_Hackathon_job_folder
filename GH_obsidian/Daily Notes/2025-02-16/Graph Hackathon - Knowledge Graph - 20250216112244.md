Your `main.ts` looks correct, but **since the plugin still isn't loading**, let's do a **full verification and fix any remaining issues** step by step.

---

## **âœ… Step 1: Check for Missing `view.js`**

Run:

```sh
ls -l /home/mike/Documents/Programming/Graph_Hackathon_job_folder/GH_obsidian/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-triple-extractor/
```

If **`view.js` is missing**, rebuild and copy all `.js` files from `dist/`:

```sh
npm run build
cp dist/*.js ./
```

---

## **âœ… Step 2: Verify All JavaScript Files Exist**

After running the above, you should have:

```
main.js
manifest.json
parser.js
store.js
view.js
```

If **any of these are missing**, let me know!

---

## **âœ… Step 3: Check Import Paths in `main.ts`**

Make sure your imports use **relative paths**:

```ts
import { parseTriples } from "./parser";
import { KnowledgeGraphStore } from "./store";
import { TripleView } from "./view"; // Ensure "./view" is correct
```

If Obsidian **still can't find `view.js`**, try changing it to:

```ts
import { TripleView } from "view";
```

---

## **âœ… Step 4: Restart Obsidian Completely**

If the plugin still doesnâ€™t load:

1. **Disable the plugin** in **Settings â†’ Community Plugins**.
2. **Close Obsidian completely** (`pkill obsidian` on Linux).
3. **Restart Obsidian** and **enable the plugin again**.

---

### **ðŸš€ Final Steps**

4. **Run:**
    
    ```sh
    npm run build
    cp dist/*.js ./
    ```
    
5. **Verify `view.js` exists** using `ls -l`.
6. **Restart Obsidian and try enabling the plugin again**.
